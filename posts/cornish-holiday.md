140 days of lockdown.

Or 20 weeks.

Or 38.25% of the year.

How I needed a holiday!!

Camping in the south of France, not quite. A close second, Bath.

We stayed in [The Blackberries Campsite](https://theblackberriescampingpark.co.uk/) which had a pen with four gentle goats, the kids spent hours feeding and playing with them. By the end of our time there, they had named the goats and even managed to cover one in blackberry juice.

The campsite was in a village where a friend of mine used to live and we went to the woods around Brown's Folly. In this wood, I fell off a rope swing and broke my arm when I was twelve. It was the first time I've been back and I found the same spot. There was even a rope swing there. Asher loved it and needless to say there were no broken bones.

BB and Hedge turned up and the children were so excited to see them. They had barely seen each other since lockdown began and went straight to the goats.

That evening when we sat down to eat dinner it there was a palpable release. It was like all the isolation and tension of lockdown dissapated. It's hard to express to how tangible it was, 140 days of restrictions and constrictions lifted off.

The following day we went to my old school. The schoool is located in a steep-sided river valley, the playing fields are on the flood plain and the school spreads up one side of the valley. It was strange to be back, very nostalgic. We parked by our old bording house, which was the school building furtherst up the valley. We regaled the boys about how we would walk down to the dining hall every morning for breakfast. I have vivid memories of leaving the house and looking down into the valley, the bottom completely obscured by fog. A river of fog stood over the school and I would descend into it. I don't remember having a jacket and I would head into crisp mornings shivering.

A drung led down to school, I learnt every inch of it in my two years walking up and down it every day. It was strange doing it again as an adult, I wanted to pick up sticks and wack the nettles, climb on the low wall and run down it pell-mell. In the end I settled with walking and being aware of the uncomfortable feeling of heading back to the school. This feeling only increased as I got closer to the bottom of the drung.

I think this growing sense of unease stems from feeling that I should have achieved more with my life so far. It would be considered a posh school by most, which I've always felt ashamed of attending. It's not information I freely give to people. Even worse is the idea of seeing some of the people I went to school with, an overwhelming sense of shame takes hold of me. So as I entered the quad, memories came flooding back to me. It was strange, the kids were so excited to hear stories, but I felt like I was masquerading about. I shouldn't have gone back. It was almost like I was tarnishing my memory of the place. Or by being there, I had let down the school because I hadn't done it's memory justice. Seeing pictures of my grandmother on the wall didn't help.

It's not to say that I didn't enjoy being back, explaining things to Caitlyn, Caleb and Asher. I could see Caitlyn, trying to coax me out of my listless mood. It's at times like these her beauty shines out, she is so gentle with me, she nudges and helps me to put meaning to what I'm feeling. Truly I am blessed to have a wife so gentle and kind.

Ayway enough of this. Off to Cornwall.

Glorious weather. Moomaid. Family. Surfing.

On a couple of days, the surf wasn't too big, so we took Asher and Dylan surfing. They had so much fun. They could have stayed in the water all day, if we hadn't forced them to come back in because their lips were blue and their teeth were chattering.

On the drive back to Leicester Caitlyn said that it was probably the best family holiday we had been on. And I would have to agree with her.
