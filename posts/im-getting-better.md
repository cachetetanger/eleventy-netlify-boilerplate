Going into marriage my excitement was only exceeded by the false expectations I had about it. After a few weeks the excitement turned to disappointment and frustration as reality challenged my unrealistic views of marriage. Five years on I now have a better understanding of what marriage entails and my expectations have changed dramatically. My marriage has definitely improved and I am a more rounded individual. The same is true of how I play football. I remember the lead up to my first game with Park End. I hadn't played much football on a full-size pitch and I thought I was going to be the best player on the field.

Then reality struck.

I think I must have touched the ball about five times, I chased a ball over the top for about thirty metres but hadn't heard the whistle for an earlier foul and could barely breathe afterwards. The cramp hit my calves early in the second half so I hobbled around the rest of the game. When I got home my back was so sore I could barely stand up after sitting down. It was humiliating(and painful) feeling I had the body of a sixty year old, I realised I needed to work hard to get fit if I was going to make any impression on future games. Now three years on with three years of football behind me gone is the naive, tactically inept Tom. I have improved massively over that time and now I'm tactically and positionally so much more aware. This pre-season I've been given the captain's armband and I'm really enjoying myself. We have a good team this year with players who are comfortable on the ball which allows us to play a more enjoyable brand of football. Most of our pre-season games have been against vets teams which means we've had space and time on the ball, I am sure when the season starts proper it'll become tougher.

Our game this Sunday was against Broughton Astley Vets, they had a few of their reserve team players in the squad. They were pretty poor and we beat them three two but should have scored more. Both their goals were from dead ball situations where we didn't mark our men properly, other than that I can only recall one other shot by them. Last season we comfortably beat them twice so we should be taking points from them this year too.

I scored my first goal of the season, the ball was crossed in and I got in front of a static defender to head in off the crossbar. I can tell I am a better player from my movement to get in front of the defender, the header well that was a fluke it could have gone anywhere off my fifty pence head. If I get to five goals this year, my mate Mark said he would bake me a quiche. Only four more goals to go before I get to tuck into some crusty, eggy, cheesy goodness. I also set up a goal where I was one-on-one with the keeper and squared to Joe for a tap in.

My friend Dickens is playing this year and is a good addition to the team. He plays centre-back and barks instructions, I had a chuckle when he told Heath to play five yards off his line as we were holding a high line. I didn't think Heath would come off his line but he played well and claimed a lot of balls which in previous seasons I am sure he wouldn't have come for.

We lost our way a bit in the second half and started to hit longer passes and a few of our players were beginning to get frustrated. Especially Alex, he is a good player and wants the ball to feet, he can skin a couple of players effortlessly so we need to get better at bringing him into the game more. Overall it was a good performance in our last pre-season game, hopefully it's an indicator of what is to come. I am busy on Saturdays for the next three weeks so I'm going to miss the opening few fixtures of the season, lets hope I come back to with two wins under our belts.

##### Technology in Football

Benteke's winner against Bournemouth has raised the question of technology in football again. It took far too long for goal line technology to be part of the game. How long will it be before we use technology to check if a goal was offside. I think football should adopt something similar to what happens in cricket. When a wicket is taken they check to see if a no-ball was bowled. In football they should check to see if a goal was offside before awarding it. It's so obvious and would take no time at all, I don't understand why it hasn't happened already. Well I do, I am sure the powers that be will fight it before finally giving in ten years too late.

##### Rookie Mistakes

Winston looked like a rookie which is what he is but if I was a Bucs fan I would be a little worried about the pick. It is still early days and he could learn from his mistakes but he has a long road ahead of him if he is going to be a success. Have the Chargers wasted another first round pick on a running back? Melvin Gordon did not look good, again it is a bit early to make a decision but he seemed hesitant behind the line. I am hoping he is more consistent than Matthews who only showed flashes and gave us one good season. Also Matthews is going to have a monster injury free season in Philly, I just know it, Ajirotutu will probably be immense too.

Why?

Why do I support the Chargers?

We aren't even re-signing our best defensive player!! Will I still support you when you are in LA? I can't bring myself to think about it.
