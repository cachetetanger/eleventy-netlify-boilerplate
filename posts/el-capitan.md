One game that stands out to me growing up was Man Utd against Juventus in the Champions League semi-final in Turin, Roy Keane was incredible that night. I will never forget his reaction to being [booked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=t2RVQx8J2Sk#t=204), turning on a teammate in fury. By sheer force of personality he managed to pull the rest of the team through for a famous victory.

I have been appointed vice-captain for the season, I think because no-one else wanted the job. As our captain couldn't play last Saturday I was The Captain. By watching Keane's performance again I was hoping it would inspire me to perform heroically. Alas, it didn't make any difference. I was pretty poor, slow off the mark and half a yard behind the opposition. We were playing Birstall Reserves who had been two divisions above us but folded halfway through last season. The league accepted their request to re-entre a team in Division Three as opposed to Division One.

I won the toss, or to be more specific their captain called it wrong. I had my first decision to make as captain, I chose to play the way we were facing as opposed to get the players to swap ends. They thought they were in for an easy ride, they passed the ball well but could not break us down. They had a penalty shout turned down and we went straight up the other end and won a penalty, which Dave converted. Last season we had a bet to see who would score more goals, he scored two and I scored one. We have the same bet this season and everyone is saying he has won it already. We went into half-time one nil up.

Heath our ageing keeper had to go off at half-time as he hurt his knee by standing on a bit of uneven ground, I am being serious. That meant Dubsy went in goal for the second half and about a minute in they had a shot from two yards that glanced his shoulder and went over. He was claiming reactions of a cat and calling himself [Uchoa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=MAqRlSiHvQE#t=96), although it was definitely a case of the ball hitting him rather than him saving it. They equalised and their tails were up but we managed to keep it tight for ten minutes and no-one panicked, I was trying to be vocal and encouraging and not let peoples heads drop.

Throughout the game we struggled and hit so many long balls straight to their keeper, when our strikers did get the ball our midfielders were nowhere near them for support. However I grabbed my moment when it came, I nicked the ball off my opposite number, megging him in the process(a complete fluke). I ran past one challenge from the right-back who had come infield and ran at the two central defenders. They both came to me and I fed Pete in the now vacant right-back channel and he took a touch before burying the ball in the far corner.

Their frustration began to mount as their efforts for an equaliser didn't materialise. At a goalkick the player marking me barged me before the ball was kicked, I looked at him and laughed and then he kicked me. I love it when we get under opponents skin, not because we are in their face, but because we are better than they expect. Although he had the last laugh as he was my man and I let him run by me onto a through ball which he squared for their equaliser. The game ended two all which was a fair result, we scrapped hard against a better team and they were unable to create chances to get the win. Walking back to the changing room the difference in the body language between the teams was night and day. We were chuffed with the result, we could have played better but we showed spirit. They were pissed off and dejected, especially as they thought they were going to batter us.

Anyway I am off to Zambia for a two weeks, when I return I expect Spurs to be top of the table and the Chargers unbeaten.
