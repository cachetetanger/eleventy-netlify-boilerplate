We lost again. It was frustrating and the lack of pace in the team is starting to show week in week out. Two of their goals came from a ball over the top. It is so frustrating to concede goals like that as they take the wind out of you. You can be battling away and then one ball destroys all the hard work. This meant the defense sat right back but that left so much space in the middle. I couldn't get close to their midfielders, not having played for two weeks was showing. Pete and James weren't playing, which makes a huge difference. When they play it means we are able to keep the ball better and opposition defenses worry about them. We ended up losing 6-3.

This is now our fifth loss in a row and a few people have dropped out, refusing to play for such a crap team. Morale is low, the good start to the season has meant that everyone's expectations were raised. I thought this might happen, hopefully there won't be anymore players dropping out.

###### Clock Management 101

How Atlanta lost the game shows how dysfunctional they are at the moment. They remind me of the Jets, but it's worse because Atlanta actually have talent. Next season under a new head coach I bet they win ten games and make it to the playoffs.

Now, onto how they contrived to lose the game from a winning position. Let me say this clearly Atlanta should not have lost this game. Everyone watching knew what needed to happen, eat up the clock and force the Browns use their three timeouts. Atlanta were down 21-23 and had a 3rd and 1 on Cleveland's 46, Steven Jackson ran 3 yards for a first down. This is where it got bizarre, Atlanta were in field goal range, admittedly a long one but inside Matt Bryant's career long of 62 yards. They should have let the play clock run down close to zero before getting off the next play, using up the clock or forcing Cleveland to burn a timeout. Instead from the shotgun they ran a passing play for a gain of 1 yard and only used up 29 seconds from the start of the last play. On 2nd and 9 they went no huddle and Ryan completed a 7 yard pass. So at 3rd and 2 on Cleveland's 35 with 55 seconds remainging Cleveland call a timeout.

Oh wait did I say Cleveland I meant Atlanta.

Ok so you have messed up clock management and have called a timeout. Move on from that, it is 3rd and 2 try to get a first down by running the ball and force Cleveland to use their timeouts. Hey Mike Smith, get Cleveland to use their timeouts so at least if they do get the ball back with time on the clock they will find it very very hard to get into field goal range. So remember, run the ball to try and get a first down and run out the clock....oh wait you are throwing it and it's incomplete.

I still don't understand it. So now Atlanta are kicking a field goal with 49 seconds remaining, have I mentioned that Cleveland still has all three of their timeouts. The field goal is good, so Cleveland have to get into field goal range for a chance to win. You have to credit Hoyer here, his last two posessions ended with interceptions from very poor throws. The game was on the line, they were on their own 20 with 44 seconds remaining and yes three timeouts, he completed four straight passes before spiking the ball on the Atlanta 19. Cundiff essentially had a chip shot to win the game as time expired.

After the game Smith had this to say. "The 53-yarder was definitely outside the range we set prior to the game. We wanted to get a first down, and we felt like we had a play that's why we called the timeout. We came over and used it. They would've used the timeout probably if we hadn't." This is where his logic has gone awry, you don't call a timeout to save the opposition from calling a timeout. How would Cleveland had fared on the last drive if they had one fewer timeouts. Atlanta are 8-19 since the beginning of last season, I think it is time for a change.

The Chargers haven't been playing well in recent weeks, perhaps Rivers has a [rib injury](http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/11/18/san-diego-chargers-philip-rivers-rib-injury), it was nice to beat St Louis although I expect us to be brushed aside against better opposition.

Spurs, who won again thanks to only playing against [ten men](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30072815)[(again)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29775975), maybe we could do this every week.
