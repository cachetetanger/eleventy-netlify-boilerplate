Saturday was really warm and muggy and as I got moved back into centre midfield I knew I was going to be in for a long day. They were not a particularly good team and didn't really track players when they lost possession, so I had a bit of time on the ball. We didn't have a good striker so we played with five midfielders and only one up front. It was hard to get up and support our striker and so we didn't create too many really clear chances. We were pretty solid at the back, even if we didn't have a lot of the ball. They didn't create much either as their players didn't release the ball early. A through ball eventually found its way through our defence and our keeper, who doesn't inspire the most amount of confidence was easily beaten. At half-time we were pretty pleased with our performance, if we could pass the ball around a bit better then we should be able to get a goal or two. The second half was one of the longest I have played, there were two bad knee injuries which took over 10 minutes to be sorted. A substitution of ours took about three minutes because when the player came on he had forgotten his shinpads, so he had to run the length of the pitch to retrieve them. There was also a stream with a bank overgrown with nettles along oneside of the pitch so when the ball went off that side someone would have to scrabble around trying not to get stung. Our goal was a little comical. They had a throw-in near the halfway line, instead of throwing it down the line the player threw it back to their keeper. Our striker closed him down and he tried to knock it past him with a fancy trick which failed miserably and the striker ran the ball into an empty net. It was his first touch of the ball as he had just come on as a sub. Sometimes two great teams cancel each other our, well we just cancelled each other out because neither of us had any real quality. The game ended one all which was probably a fair result as there weren't many clear cut chances. We have our first point and our season is up and running. Speaking of running, I have been on quite a few shorter runs this week which have included sprints. I need to make it into the opposition box more and so these runs should help. I want those comfy sandals.

I love beating the Cowboys. It is great to see them lose again, especially after all the hype that had been building up around them. More importantly it brings us to a two two record and we were able to hold out in the fourth quarter and force a turnover. The Rivers pass to Gates was a thing of beauty. It will still be a tall order to make it into the playoffs but at least the team is playing well and Rivers has time to make his throws.
