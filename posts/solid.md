The last time I went to the States was with my wife and three month old boy, we had a four hour layover in Chicago before a connecting flight onto Seattle. In the baggage hall we were waiting for our suitcases at the carousel when the sniffer dog sat down next to me. My first thought was 'Has someone planted drugs in my bag? Oh Shit! Oh Shit! Oh Shit! I am going to prison!' My thoughts were interrupted by a polite but firm dog handler who asked if she could have a look in our hand luggage. 'She has gun! Oh Shit, she has a gun!' I open my bag slowly thinking this might be the last time I would see my wife and son for years. 'Are those sandwiches?' I nodded. 'Do they have meat in them?' I nodded. 'Sir, you are not allowed to bring meat in to the United States of America. I will need to take them from you.' She took the sandwiches we had prepared to eat during our layover as we were on a tight budget for the holiday. The smug dog was still sitting there. The handler gave it a treat and 'a good job' before walking away with my sandwiches. I could have [kicked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym-toH7EF1c) it to kingdom come. This time we remembered to eat our sandwiches before we landed.

It is very different experience going through immigration with an American wife and child. The border staff were very jovial and one made a joke to my wife along the lines of 'Why would you want to live in England?' before giving me a steely look. I panicked and smiled lamely back at him. A benefit of having a Southern Californian wife is that in the middle of February I am able to write this blog in blazing sunshine whilst enjoying a cold beer, my pale English skin getting sun burnt in the process.

This means I won't be playing football for a few weeks as I am on holiday. I may write one or two blogs whilst I am here about what I get up to and more importantly what I eat.

##### Park End

It was a solid win for us against poor opposition. They had one player who had a good touch but the rest of their players were not very good. They brought on a couple of subs who were decent and it seemed strange that they didn't start. The running joke before the game was Dovey only being a sub. He got quite a bit of stick, especially when we ended up winning the game. It was Dave who took his place, so he was bragging about coming back into the team and getting us back onto winning ways. Dovey did look a bit glum before the game and stood on the sideline with Lee, who still comes to games despite his broken arm to shout instructions at us. I say instructions and I did find them useful, but sometimes it turned into a slagging match between them and some of our players.

It was 2-0 in the end, our first clean sheet of the season and our first for nearly a [year.](http://full-time.thefa.com/DisplayFixture.do?id=1348311) Kyle got both the goals, both set up by Banzi, who could have scored a couple himself. It was very comfortable in the end with Heath only having to make one meaningful save. The win puts us back up to third in the table with more points than we got last season in three fewer games.
