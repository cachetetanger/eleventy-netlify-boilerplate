I ran the hundred metres in a time of 15 seconds when I was 13. I was very envious of my mates who ran it in 14 seconds, one mate Henry was close to 13 seconds, unbelieveable. That was back in the summer of 1995. Nearly twenty years on and it doesn't feel like I am any quicker.

At Park End we must be pushing for the slowest football team ever assembled, [William'Fatty' Foulke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Foulke_(footballer)) would give some of our players a good run for their money.

I have always imagined myself running gracefully like a gazelle in the Savannah, covering ground with ease, others watching in slack-jawed awe as I close down opponents, nick the ball off them and pull away with a sharp burst of acceleration. Never tiring, a constant source of energy, every limb and sinew flexed in a poetry of motion. The reality is somewhat different, I am more like Andy Bernard in The Office, when he runs behind Kevin to use as little energy as possible. By limiting the number of times a game I get into the opposition's box to only a couple, saves me energy(I don't count corners). Covering an area twenty metres either side of the halfway line allows me to look like I have bags of energy. The reality is quite different, since injuring my ankle my mechanics are all over the place and I have a rather lopsided gait. It struck me how slow I am when I tried to track my man and couldn't keep up with him. The realisation that Father Time is catching up with me was also enforced when I woke up the following morning with a sore back and stiff ankle. A stiff ankle, who gets a stiff ankle?

We lost the game two one, but we played pretty well and there was an almighty rainstorm for most of the game. It lashed it down and because our changing rooms were locked all my clothes were wet when I changed back into them. I was shivering, this is August, what is going on?

I feel fitter now than I did at this point last season. My aim for this season(which was last season's aim) is to get into the oppositions box regularly and get two goals this season.
