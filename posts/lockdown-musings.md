I am one the lucky ones. The few who have enjoyed lockdown. A lack of external pressure and heaps of time for myself, have brought me a keen sense of contentment. Unlike my poor sister-in-law, who has felt more and more isolated. She's slowly going mad and if Leicester isn't let out of lockdown soon, I'd fear for her children.

The first two months were glorious, sultry sunny days and I was furloughed. The novelty of it all was exciting. Homeschool, was a challenge, but if you stop at lunch(on a good day) that still leaves the afternoon to enjoy oneself. Trying to juggle the role of being dad and teacher was nigh on impossible for me, the further into lockdown we went, the less work the boys did. Ten minutes? good enough for me!

It is the first time since Caleb was born that I've had lots of time for myself. For me it is a precious thing, sacred even. To be able to sit and think, without interruption, bliss. I've had so little of that for such a long time, it's reawakened a purpose.

A purpose to understand my significance.

To say I feel insignificant would be putting too little import on the word. Often I view my life as inconsequential and decrepid. What good I bring to my family is negligible and wrecked by my tetchiness. I have an anger that can burn so hot it becomes an almost uncontrollable rage. A rage which, at times needs only the slightest provocation, to explode.

Is it provocation? I should add that this rage is usually directed at my two boys, who are not trying to provoke me. Their buffoonery and childish mirth irks me at best and offends me at worst. But how?

I look back at my childhood and I can see myself repeating the same way of relating to my children as my parents did to me. That is obviously as old as humankind, but it is rather chilling when it strikes so close to home.

My infantile antics would draw my mothers ire. Which was so unfair. I didn't know any better. Although I did learn quickly what was acceptable and what wasn't, how to avoid her disapproval at any cost. A rebuke, although never enjoyable, stung more than I can say. Only now can I see how much someone's disapproval of me elicits suffocating terror. Now that I am in the parent role, all to regularly permeating disdain and a peevish mien, it is frankly a little disturbing. Like me before them, my children know no better, I need to make allowances for that.

When I am able to step back and look back on my day, I often say to myself 'What was I thinking?' How can I let my children live in this morose atmosphere.

It is one of many things that brings overwhelming feelings of shame and guilt. My tendency in these moments is to embrace the feelings, to feed the self-loathing and spite, a form of self-harm. An emotional self-harm. See I do feel. I can crave these moments. It feels horrible, yet so familiar, and by being familiar it brings comfort. I know where I fit, I can place myself in my rightful position. At the bottom. I was starting to think I was cared for, that my feelings were valid, that someone wants to listen to what I have to say.

No, no, no, no, no!

Don't get too big for your boots Thomas. You're not important. You're worthless. In fact you're worse than worthless because you are powerless to do anything about it. You can't change. You will never change. Stop hoping for something. It's a waste of time.

I acquiesce. The familiar shutting down of hope and the equally familiar accession of despair. I am nothing. I will never be anything. Stop expecting anything good to happen. Now get your head down and don't draw attention to yourself.

When writing the last two paragraphs, I am surprised by how little they resonate with me. That is how my life worked. It was comforting when I got to that place. There was no expectation on me. Which in turn meant I had nothing to give. I liked those experiences, I knew where I fit and would avoid any situation where I might fail.

Now, I'm more hopeful. More valuable. More valued. I still succumb to feelings of despair and powerlessness, but generally they are fleeting. I am actually amazed at how hopeful I have become, this is a new experience for me.
