Watching an older couple on bikes without helmets slowly coming past me down a slight hill, brought up a sense of panic. What if they went over the handlebars? Why are they not wearing helmets? I wanted to look away.

Even now over a year and a half later, dropping off the kerb onto the road I have to fight the panic that rises as my front wheel hits the road. I expect the fork to break and to land face first on the tarmac.

On the night of the crash, once I got in the ambulance, my experience was a healing one. A month before the crash I'd cut my finger on my mitre saw and had to go to A&E to have it stitched back up. I attempted to read but the pain in my finger kept distracting me.

I began to cry, but quickly made myself stop. I cried, not only beacuase of the pain, but also because I was alone. I spurned the offer of help from my friends and now regretted it. I wanted someone to be there with me, to share in my pain.

When I got home I momentarily broke down in front of Caitlyn. It shocked me. I didn't realise how much I needed someone to comfort me. This momentarily lapse in my protection mechanisms elicited shame and embarrassment. I shut myself down, stopped the tears, pushed Caitlyn away and withdrew to safer distance.

Back in the ambulance, the two paramedics busied themselves over me. One bandaged my head and then made a cast for my arm, the other kept asking for the hospital postcode.

A&E was busy, I was number fourteen in the queue, they parked on a grass verge as the car park was full. One paramedic trundled off to A&E whilst I chatted with the other. She had left her job as a nurse because the pay was crap and trained as a paramedic, as the pay was better. It struck me as contradictory, professions primarily about caring, being chosen for economic gains. It shows how little, we as a society value healthcare jobs, doctors being the exception. She couldn't believe I would cycle to Loughborough and back for work and told me at least twice, 'You must be skint to do that.' I felt like saying, 'Nah, just enjoy the exercise.' but didn't think she would believe me.

The other paramedic came back with the news that we'd have to wait in the ambulance until we got called into see a doctor. We resigned ourselves to a long wait and made ourselves comfortable. My pain levels were not to bad, my arm still ached but my head wasn't bothering me too much. At one point a nurse checked on me, but other than that it was just the three of us chatting.

There was a knock on the door and BB was standing there when it opened. I nearly burst into tears when I saw him. I couldn't believe he was there. At that moment I felt so touched. I managed to hold back the tears and BB joined us in the Ambulance.

Caitlyn turned up a little later with Sequoia. It wasn't exactly a party in the ambulance but there was lots of ribbing and laughter. BB wouldn't shut up about my nose.

It took a few hours to be x-rayed and stitched up. Everyone who dealt with me chastised me for not wearing a helmet. A friend had kindly come over to look after the children so Caitlyn could be with me. The importance of support, friends and family who came to my aid, made me realise I'm valued.
