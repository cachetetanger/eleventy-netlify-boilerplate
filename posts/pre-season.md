And so it begins. The last game I played in early May seems a long time ago, my fitness and touch have deserted me and now the long hard slog to get them back begins. Football at this time of year is so different to the rest of the season, it is hot and the ground is rock solid. Fitness levels are poor and consequently the football on display tends to be awful. I normally start terribly and slowly improve as my fitness level gets better.

I thought I should give myself a few targets to aim for this season, not that they are much help to me but it seems like something that someone who is writing a blog should do. Last season I said I wouldn't shave unless I scored and after four months of playing with no goals I had a ridiculous beard. I aim to do the same this year with one major difference, score goals. How hard can it actually be to score. I have a bet with a colleague who said he would give me his Birkenstock sandals and a pair of socks if I hit twenty this year.

If this doesn't spur me on to hit the old onion sack nothing will. Joking aside I am going for five goals this year and goals in friendlies count. I don't really know what other personal aims I should have for this season. I will keep it simple and aim to score 5 goals this season.
