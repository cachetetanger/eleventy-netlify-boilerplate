Our last friendly of pre-season felt like a game of it against boys who were older and faster than me. A minute into the game their striker controlled a ball dead that was pinged into him from about forty yards, laid it off to a midfielder and made a run into space to receive the return ball. My centre midfield partner looked at me and said 'It's going to be a long night.' He was dead right. I couldn't run for the last ten minutes of the game as I had cramp, they might as well have buried me there on the pitch for all I moved. It was frustrating as I haven't had it all pre-season, just goes to show how little possession we had. Although we went two nil up it always felt like they would come back into the game and we ended up losing five three. They were by far the best team I have played in my two years at Park End. Even though we lost it was encouraging to have held our own for long stretches of the game. We had three new lads playing who were decent, especially as they were young which meant they were full of running. If they stay with us for the rest of the season we should do pretty well.

I went camping over the bank holiday weekend in Snowdonia, which was beautiful despite some inclement weather. However I lost my phone, which after a full day exposed to the elements was found in a car park, it is to be posted to me, hopefully it still works. Also I came back Monday night to find Spurs top of the league after winning four nil and in the build up to our third goal we kept the ball for over two minutes and every player was involved. Even though we were playing a poor QPR side it is nice to see us playing teams off the park. I doubt we will get top four this year but we should play attractive football and who knows maybe win a cup.

Elsewhere it looks like Van Gaal and the rest of us realise that it is going to take a little while for Man Utd to start winning (they are currently losing to MK Dons in the League Cup). Man City have picked up from where they left off last season, seriously how good is Aguero he makes scoring look so easy. Liverpool are really going to struggle against the top teams without Suarez. His energy and aggression were really missed by Liverpool and Sturridge doesn't look as dangerous without him. Which would be true for any striker, it is a massive blow for them and it will be anything but boring with Balotelli, Rodgers is  no doubt hoping he will develop into a [top top top top player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4x0e2IAAgE).

Only one more pre-season game for the Chargers before the season kicks off proper. Great to see Liuget terrorising Kaepernick, maybe our defense can bring more pressure to the opposing qb this year. Can't wait for the season to kickoff although I will be on holiday in Zambia and will miss the first two games.

Our first game of the season is on Saturday......
