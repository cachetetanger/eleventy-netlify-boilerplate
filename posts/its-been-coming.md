I feel so old when I play football especially as everyone seems to be getting younger, faster and more skilful. I have no idea how old they are, they could be anywhere between sixteen to twenty four, I genuinely I have no idea. Last Wednesday I played a five-aside game and there was a player who skinned me at will, he had a smooth hairless babyface and for all I know was still in his teens. This has never happened to me, I have been skinned many times but this kid did it over and over. If I got close to him he put it past me with ease, so I didn't close him down and he had too much space and time to pick a pass or shoot. It was a little depressing and I felt like I made the right decision in deciding to stop playing football on Saturdays once this season ends. This was confirmed when we got spanked 9-0 on Saturday. It was probably the worst game of football I have been involved in. We were atrocious and they were a moaning nasty team, which wasn't a surprise when their coach threatened to 'Fucking knock our linesman out.' Which is bad enough in of itself but the fact he had is young son with him made it completely abhorrent. They mocked us mercilessly and when their striker scored their seventh he taunted our keeper by celebrating in his face. It was a miserable game to be a part of and I was run ragged by young kids who were not only quicker than me but had far more desire. I've got to get through one more game and then I'm done and it feels good to be finishing with the knowledge that'll I be able to spend Saturdays with my wife and boys.

I'm obsessed with this hypnotic [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfZmFoEkSSk) at the moment.
