It happens to everyone who plays football, for some it happens more often than it should but this was the first time it happened to me.

I gave away a penalty.

We were down to ten men, more on that later and had arguably been the better side and it was one all with only a few minutes to go when they won a corner. It went deep over my head to the far post where I was standing I turned and one of their players headed it back across the goal. The ball was about shoulder height and I [pawed](http://i.imgur.com/HroqrKY.gif) at it and then heard the dreaded whistle. I couldn't believe I had done it, instinct took over and for some reason this urge came over me to swat the ball. The worse thing about it was Heath had been directly behind me, the ball was going straight to him. Dickens was on his knees with his head buried in his shirt, after the game he said to my brother 'If that had been anyone other than Tommy I would have lost it on them!'

It is only a game of football played at a poor standard but it still hurts to give away a peno, especially when they scored it to win the game. To make matters worse I was shaking hands with opposition players when I saw Kyle, who had been sent off earlier in the game, running towards the ref. I ran over and stood in between them to make sure Kyle didn't do anything stupid. He was livid with the red card decision, the referee was clearly shaken by Kyle's outburst. I would have shat my pants too, Kyle is massive. The referee submitted a report to the league later in the week and it looks like Kyle will probably miss at least six months if not more. He deserves the ban, the ref probably thought he was going to endure a beating and no-one should be subjected to abuse like that. It raises the question of behaviour on a football pitch and why people change into aggressive, foul-mouthed thugs when in any other walk of life this type of behaviour would not be tolerated.

We lost the following weeks game against Glenfield Town three one in a flat display that doesn't bode well for the rest of the season. Compared to last season we have more young players, we are not passing the ball particularly well and the inexperience is showing. It has been a frustrating few weeks but we now have a two week break so hopefully things will improve in our next game.

##### The Chargers

They can't stop the run! It's like having a convertible in England, you may have a great car but you never get to enjoy it with the top down because the weather is crap. We have really good corner backs but it doesn't matter because we can't stop teams getting first downs when they run the ball. I think we will struggle to be a .500 team. As always I am the pessimist when it comes to the teams I support, watch spurs lose to

The University of Leicester Longhorns start their season on the 8th November which will give me a chance to watch football live. It always felt a bit naff to me how MLS teams adopted European football team names, [Real Salt Lake](http://www.realsaltlake.com/) being the worse. If MLS team names are naff then UK university American football team names are downright shoddy, in the Midlands alone there are the Birmingham Lions, DMU Falcons, Coventry Jets and the aforementioned Leicester Longhorns.
