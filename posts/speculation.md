A friend I worked with said that he was going to write a science fiction book called Speculation in which nothing happened, which pretty much sums up the NFL off season. Ok, so there is free agency and the draft but aside from that, nada. Having such a short football season, September to February leaves seven months of no competitive football. This leads to mountains of speculation, at first it is interesting. Free agency opens and you wonder who your team is going to sign if anyone and there is often a little drama. However after a week of 'experts' trying to predict where players will land it gets cumbersome and extremely repetitive. The same goes for the draft, I will die a happy man if I never see a mock draft again. As I have said already the reason for this hype is the short season and so they have to fill it with something. Speculation like this does my head in, I can't wait for the season to start.

My advice to you, check every now and again what has happened in the off season, it won't have been that much and you will have saved yourself a whole lot of time to dedicate to more pressing matters.
