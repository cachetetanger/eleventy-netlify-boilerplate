It was eleven thirty and I'd had a few drinks and was hit by intense feelings of sadness. The next day was my eldest son's final day of school before the Christmas holidays and the children could wear Christmas jumpers to school. Weeks before when I'd been out shopping with my wife I'd shrugged off the idea of buying him one as it seemed superfluous. Now I was being hit with waves of guilt at my niggardly act and imagined my son being the only boy in the class without one. What made it worse was that when my wife had told him he didn't have a Christmas jumper to wear his response was so affable that it broke my heart.

Even though it was coming up to midnight, cold and damp outside I decided to ride to Asda at Fosse Park to buy a Christmas jumper. This was penance for my miserly ways.

I put my D-lock in my backpack, found some gloves, changed the batteries in the front light of my bike. A quick squeeze of the tires, yep they're fine. Out into the murky night.

I start off hard, feel the burn in my quads and then sit back and enjoy the ride. I take quiet roads, they are deserted, not even a skittish fox. The light has changed, gone is the gloomy yellow glow emanating from street lights. Now the street is awash with a gleaming blue LED luminescence, which has completely altered cities at night. Gone are the murky shadows and dim half-light, now it has been replaced by something akin to fulgent moonlight. I kept wanting to tell Bilbo to put Sting away. It's as if you are walking under a cloudless sky with a full moon on steroids. I didn't pass anyone in this brightly lit world until I came across another cyclist, he hopped onto the curb before I caught him, so I didn't have the pleasure of giving him a fright as I silently whizzed by.

Asda is a horrible place, especially late at night. I was taking part in the consumerism that I detest. This was my purgatory, I strode down the aisles towards the boy's clothes, passing different shoppers. The solitary person looking intently at a shelf of gold bathroom accessories, another person wandering aimlessly staring blankly at their phone. There was a family with three young children, they too were looking for Christmas jumpers. The children exhausted, ran around with a restlessness that grated on their parents who continuously snapped at them.

I got to the boy's aisles, I marched up and down them and couldn't see any Christmas jumpers. I retraced my steps, slower this time, looking carefully. I still didn't see any. I checked again and went down adjoining aisles. There weren't any. Distress rising. I made my way to the front of the clothes section. Ah, at last, the Christmas jumpers, but there were only girls ones, oh wait here are some boys. They are only 2-3 years size. Desperate searching, checking and then re-checking the labels. Dread and foreboding. Defeated, stuck in purgatory.

To temporarily forget about my purgatory I bought peanut m&ms. I got on the bike with the open bag of m&ms in my pocket and headed to Oadby Asda. A lorry roared past me, the roads were glistening but not slippery. The only other sound I heard, other than the crunching of peanut m&ms in my jaw, was that of birdsong as I cycled past Knighton Park. It was surreal hearing it that late, I thought they'd be sleeping.

Oadby Asda looked deserted when I got there as the car park was almost empty and there was no-one about. Lock up the bike, automatic doors _do_ open, I head towards the boy's clothes hesitantly, with a sinking feeling rising. I saw them straight away, the Christmas jumpers. Only one was the right size for Asher, a cat and two dogs taking a selfie with Christmas hats and decorations superimposed on top of the photo. It was horrendous and it cost eight quid, but I took it without a moments hesitation. Adieu purgatory.

The ride back was quiet and I slipped wearily into bed a little after one. It was all worth it to see the look on my son's face when he opened the bag we'd put it in. His eyes lit up and his smile was a picture. When do we lose that sense of excitement and joy when receiving gifts?
