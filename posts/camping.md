As a child a summer holiday had to have at least one camping trip. Usually we headed to Cornwall for a week on the beach and generally I enjoyed them although towards the end of our time boredom was beginning to set in. My parents would hire a couple of surfboards and my siblings and I would take turns. I could never stay in the water for very long and it wasn't until my parents bought wetsuits that I was able to spend more than an hour in the sea. Even then I would come out shivering and my parents would have a thermos of sweet tea ready and waiting for us along with towels and wooly jumpers. For lunch were the sandwiches we'd made in the morning, there would be a few digestives and if we were lucky some chocolate ones too. My parents had a disgusting habit of re-using old milk bottles as water bottles, which gave the water a distinctive taste of sour milk.

One of our favourite places on the beach were some rocks, which when the tide came in created a pool which you could dive into called the [Sheep Dip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdZAjCQeN8k) You would then be at the mercy of waves and if you weren't careful you could be tossed into the rocks. We loved the danger of it and one of the ways out was through what we dubbed 'The Crack'. A narrow channel between rocks which got progressively narrower and you could be thrown out 'The Plughole' like a rag doll if you weren't careful. Before a wave the water would 'suck' you towards the entrance of the crack and then when a wave came in the water would rush down the crack and get higher as it got narrower and send you smashing into the side or out the plughole. To stop this happening we would grab onto any outcrop of rock we could find, we normally came out with nasty grazes and cuts all over our bodies from the barnacles on the rocks.

The last time we went camping as a family I was fifteen, we had gone to bed with clear skies. I woke to rain falling on my face, the whole tent had blown over. We scampered about like woodlice when you lift up a rock they've been living under. The tent which was already tatty was now definitely not going to last another camping trip. We righted the tent, pegged it down and the remainder of the night I slept fitfully expecting the tent to blow over again.

My wife loves camping and has been pestering me about it for awhile now. So I told her 'You pick the place and date and we'll go.' Last weekend we finally packed up the car and headed off to Shropshire. About thirty miles from Bishop's Castle the rain began, it had been threatening to do so for awhile. The surrounding countryside became murky under the dark clouds making it hard to see as I peered out the rain strewn windscreen. At this point I was silently cursing my wife for choosing this weekend of all weekends to go camping, the forecast showed thunder storms for the following day so I hadn't much hope for the rest of the trip. The campsite was about a mile down a single track road. The type of road which had moss in the middle of it and high hedges so you can't see if anything is coming around corners.

The campsite was on a farm, in a sloping field, our pitch was next to friends who'd managed to save us a flat spot at the top of the field. The rain had stopped by now and we were able to set up our tent without worrying about getting wet, my biggest concern was making sure my two year old son didn't go into other people's tents. In this I was unsuccessful but fortunately any embarrassment I might have felt was avoided because the tent he got into was empty at the time.

I love cooking when camping because of the effort to make the simplest of meals, it gives me an immense amount of satisfaction when I finally get to sit down and eat it. The coffee in the morning tastes so good too, the only time I ever feel groggy in the morning is when camping, coffee is the stimulant which helps to wake me up. However I no longer get to sit quietly and enjoy the coffee now that I have two boys. My favourite piece of equipment was my chair. I hate sitting on the ground without a support for my back. I can't sit cross-legged because I'm so inflexible, I was that kid in school assembly who was always wiggling. The chair enhanced my experience exponentially. Who thought sitting could be such an enjoyable experience.

My eldest loved camping, being able to run around freely in a field and when we went for a walk next to a stream he wanted to jump in it the whole time. I had to stop him until we made it to the waterfall at the top and then he splashed around in it nearly the whole time. My wife being the organised one, brought a change of clothes for him.

It is special seeing your own flesh and blood enjoying themselves so much and the little things he does crack me up. I had never seen him do this before but he started giving thumbs up to people walking past us. It was ridiculously cute, I got an urge to gobble him up right there and then.

It rained the first night and our tent leaked but we only realised in the morning, fortunately not too much water came in. I put a groundsheet over the tent to protect it from the thunderstorm forecast for the second night. I woke to water dripping into our pod. When you become a dad/husband everyone in the family(read wife) looks to you to do the jobs no-one else wants to. I put on my rain jacket and flip flops and emerged from the tent into pouring rain. The groundsheet had moved in the wind so I put it back into place and tied it on more securely this time. I crawled back into the tent dried myself off and like the last time I went camping with my family had a fitful night sleep expecting water to start dripping in at any moment.

It never did.
