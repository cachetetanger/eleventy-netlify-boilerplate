I have not won a game of football for over a month. From top of the league to now falling, falling fast and it's [painful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kz7YUdy-Cg). We lost 2-1 on Saturday. It was one of those games where we felt we should have got more from the game but only had ourselves to blame. We went one nil up in the first half but they equalised soon after. We need to learn to hold onto a lead, it was frustrating to be level so quickly after going ahead. Their second goal was my fault. It came from a corner and the person I was marking got to the ball just before me, I hesitated a split second which allowed him to nick in front of me. We created a few chances but they were never really under a sustained amount of pressure. My day didn't get any better I had a free header which I put wide from about 8 yards. I felt dejected at the final whistle, at the end of the day we were not good enough.

Tottenham continue their winning ways against Europa League opposition, except this time it was in the Premier League. More importantly it was a good performance and we were able to stifle their creativity even though they had lots of possession. When we had the ball we moved it with purpose and looked a threat going forward. You can't beat the bluster of Harry Kane, well you can and it will only take us so far, but I will enjoy it whilst it lasts. As I suspected we fell short against better opposition. Teams managed by Mourinho are my least favourite.

I have to confess that I thought the Chargers were going to lose to the Ravens on Sunday, along with the rest of you. I didn't watch any of it and when we went into half-time 16-10 down I expected us to fall apart in the second half. So you can imagine my surprise when I checked the score later on in the night and saw that we won by a point. A true fan. I predicted an 8-8 finish, we have 8 wins so far and our next 4 games are New England, 49ers, Denver and then the Chiefs. We are the fifth seed at the moment, if we get two more wins then I think we will be in the playoffs. I don't think one win will do it. Who knows maybe my 8-8 prediction will be correct. As I said, a true fan.

On a different note. I finally won a game of football, my work five a-side team. They all count.

I was saddened to see the tragic death of Phil Hughes from a freak accident and spare a thought for the bowler Sean Abbott, I can't imagine what he is going through.
