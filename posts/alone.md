What do you do when you feel alone or how about what if your greatest fear is to be alone. To be isolated, shunned by the ones you love. What if it is too painful to show people that you care for them. To open yourself up to them. To be vulnerable. To show those around you the inner child that you protect from harm. The inner child who, if is rejected, it doesn't bear thinking about. That is putting it mildly. It is in fact so devastating that your being, who at that point of vulnerability is so fragile, feels like it will disintegrate. It feels very real and no matter what I tell myself, I still think I will shatter into a million pieces if anyone rejects that inner child.

Most of my mental energy is spent trying to stop that child from seeing the light of day. I don't even realise it most of the time. All I know is that I am weary and depleted. Life is anguish. I used to hesitate to say suffering.

When faced with troubles I withdraw into myself, avoiding human connection at almost any cost. I don't want to be seen. To become nothing, is freeing. No expectation. Expectation is something I can't deal with. I am so sensitive to it. Resilience isn't something I possess much of and so am very easily overwhelmed. Expectation is a trigger which leads to isolating myself.
