The summer must nearly be over because pre-season is already upon us. Usually we play games on rock hard ground in temperatures getting into the mid-twenties. This time we played on a 4G pitch on a warm cloudy day, a perfect start to the season which didn't involve blistered feet or trying to control bobbling passes. It was also the first time in three seasons when I haven't woken up the next day barely being able to walk because of a sore back, honestly I am normally like [Quasimodo](http://www.thehunchblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/q-cut-3-q.png). I have been running and cycling to get myself in a condition where I was hoping to be able to run for at least a half and it has worked. This part of the season involves suffering and you have to just get through it. My lungs were burning after the first sprint and I felt light headed towards the end of the game, that is all to be expected. However my tendency is to ease off when I start to feel that way but I have read a few tips to help me get through the suffering.

1)Expect suffering. Prepare myself before the game for how much it is going to hurt, so I won't be surprised by it.

2)If I am tired, then so are the opposition. This should spur me on when I am knackered because the other team must be running on empty too.

They actually helped on Saturday, I definitely worked harder and was more prepared for how I was going to feel and didn't shy away from the pain, which is what I normally do.

I was looking forward to the game as I haven't flicked on a throw-in since the ninth of May. We played Blaby Vets, what they lacked in hair and pace they made up for with beer bellies and a propensity for leaving their foot in. Dovey was playing for them, taking the step up(?) after having enough of young whipper snappers running rings around his forty six year old legs. The first few games of the year we usually have a few new faces as Heath has this advert out saying we need new players. The advert claims the team is based near Narborough Road so we get a lot of DMU students. However once they realise we are based nowhere near there, they soon drop out, although a few normally last the season. This meant there were a number of new faces who were nervous and very quiet in the changing room. When we got to the pitch they were doing their best to make sure they didn't stand out with a poor touch or mishit pass, it was a very subdued warm up.

I felt good in the game and my energy levels were high, my first few touches were good and I had time on the ball and was playing with confidence. About ten minutes in I almost scored the best goal of my life. I won the ball on the halfway line ran past Dovey, I beat two more of their players and did a 360 spin move to beat a defender that put me through on goal. I looked up, picked my spot in the bottom corner and scuffed my shot wide.

Apart from shooting everything else I did went well well and as a team we passed the ball well and took the lead when Kyle did one of his traditional shoulder barges before squaring to Ash to sweep in from the middle of the area. Dave and I had been dominating the middle of the park for the first twenty minutes, but after the goal we brought on some subs and Dave and I went up front. The guys who came into midfield were good on the ball but a little lightweight and were pushed about a bit. The physicality of the vets showed through in the last twenty five minutes and they scored a poor equaliser from a corner. No-one picked up the wing back who received the corner, ran to the corner of the box, his shot took a deflection off the back of a defender and went in. It's little errors like this that cost us points last season, for those new players who haven't played much eleven aside they often don't help themselves by not doing the simple things. So over the next few games it will be my job to get those players to a level where they are picking up men early at corners, marking someone at a throw-in and being positionally more aware, along with telling them increase the chat between players.

The second half we dominated and when we passed the ball short we carved them open time after time. However we kept fluffing our chances, we lacked a clinical edge, which isn't surprising considering this was our first game of the season. They barely got out their half and only got the ball back when we hit hopeful forty yard passes.

I feel excited about this season, if we can keep some of the players we should be able to play a better style of football compared to last season.

Roll on next saturday.
