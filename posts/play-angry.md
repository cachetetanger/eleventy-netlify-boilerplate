When I play, I don't play angry. I used to and was a complete arse. I once got sent off in a charity football match for kicking the opposition goalie in the head. I also used to hate losing and remember one family picnic with friends when I lost a game of football and started to walk home in a strop. My mum picked me up in the car after I had walked two miles and gave me a rollicking. Fortunately she took me home so I didn't have to face up to my family and friends, embarrassment averted.

I suppose my attitude changed when I started to play Sunday League football, this is undoubtedly the worse standard of football I have been involved in. A lot of players were still drunk from the night before and teams were made up of drunks, thugs or both. Games were miserable and the team I played for were terrible and lost to every team in the league bar one. I used to play up front and would spend all game chasing lost causes knackering myself out in the process. I would only touch the ball a few times a game and being a skinny lad of 19 I was always scared of getting clattered by an oaf who stank of booze. I was top scorer that season with five goals, four of them came in the two games against the worse team. The best thing about this team was the name, Moonshine Gladbach.

Kyle has been unplayable the last two weeks. Dan Gabriel summed it up best when he said 'Kyle is a better player when he is angry.' He was awesome again today, he chased every ball, harried and hassled and shoulder barged their defenders over time and time again. At one point he was surrounded by four of their players and he brushed them aside, it reminded me of [Marshawn Lynch.](http://www.nfl.com/videos/seattle-seahawks/0ap2000000147589/Marshawn-Lynch-goes-into-beast-mode)

We sat back again and didn't leave any space in behind, it has worked the last few games. Lee broke his arm playing for a different team on Sunday, he came down to watch and shout encouragement. The defence missed him because he reads the game well and is quick which the rest of the defenders aren't. This meant sitting deep was the only sensible option. Last time we played Beaumont we lost by leaving a lot of space in behind, they scored a couple of goals from a ball over the top. We were determined not to make it so easy for them this time.

Dave was back, his first game since his [red card,](http://thecroggy.com/a-winning-draw/) it was nice to play with him in the middle again. He brings a presence to the midfield and because he is tall wins lots of headers. The pitch was in a poor state again, no puddles on it this time but there was a huge boggy patch. Dovey got taken out right in the middle of it and got mud all over his face.

The first half was pretty tight, we had a few chances, Banzi shot over and Kyle scuffed a left foot shot wide. They opened us up a few times but they too couldn't take their opportunities. They had a goalkick, I was about to go up for the header when Dave called for it. He had to cover a lot of ground to get there and mistimed his jump, flicking the ball on for their striker. To be fair I probably would have struggled to win the header. But by him coming for the header and not winning it meant that there wasn't any cover for the defence. Their striker played a through ball for his strike partner who took a shot which Heath did well to save, unfortunately the rebound fell to their winger who had a tap in.

At half-time Dovey was not happy and he hadn't even been tackled into the muddy patch yet. He laid into Dave and me, telling us to keep it simple and to move the ball quicker. Normally the half-time team talks are not quite as animated, someone usually tries to pipe in with something positive but this time no-one did. Lee told us to up our game and told us how crap their central midfielders were, which I think was meant as encouragement. We knew we could do better and it was good for Dovey to get things off his chest.

James Biddles had to come off at half-time, ever since his injury from our first game against Birstall he has not been the same. He has missed quite a few matches, hasn't completed a game or scored since then. That meant Banzi went up front with Kyle and my friend Chris made his debut coming on at right midfield.

It makes me a little anxious when I bring a player along. I am vouching for him and I want him to do well otherwise I look like a complete plank. A couple of seasons ago I brought two mates to a game one was absolutely appalling, I had never seen him play before. Honestly he was useless and I was mortified. My other mate wasn't match fit, at one point he had the ball and no one was around him and inexplicably he just fell over. I hadn't invited another friend along since then and have only just gotten over the trauma. So I was hoping Chris would be better and to be fair he held his own. He isn't match fit but he worked hard, got stuck in and listened.

Dave's heading ability led to our first goal, he headed a goalkick back past their defence for Kyle to run onto. His finish was tidy and he always looked like scoring, he has come into form these last few weeks. At this point they started to get annoyed with each other and when they took off their best defender the moaning was incessant. We weren't playing particularly good football, I was trying to get our passing going but we didn't manage to string more than three passes together in the whole game. Generally we hit it long for a striker to run onto, there was quite a bit of space in behind but how shall I put it, our passes didn't always find their target. Fortunately they weren't any better and so both teams just gave the ball away....a lot.

I almost scored again, my shot from the edge of the area was a few inches too high with the keeper rooted to the spot. It would have been good to score with Dave playing as he is one goal ahead of me in the goal stakes.

Our second goal came when Dave did a little trick and won a freekick, after the game he went on about his skill. The ball was crossed into the box and Banzi was there to tuck the loose ball away. We were good for the lead, they hadn't produced anything in the second half. Now we had 15 minutes to hold on, which we had done the week before and felt confident that we could do it again.

You know the time wasting tactic of taking the ball to the oppositions corner flag and trying to win a foul. Well Dave did that except he took it to our own corner flag, what a muppet. Fortunately he won a really soft foul. If we had conceded from his foolishness we would have been fuming.

Another solid win for us, not spectacular by any means but grinding out the results. We are now third in the table.

##### Wasted talent?

I know it is early in Martin Odegaard's career but surely the move to Real Madrid isn't right for him. I really hope it works out for the kid but I think he would have developed better by staying where he was and then moving somewhere like Ajax in a few years. Once he had established himself then a move to Real would have made sense. The money must have been a big factor, but surely long term he would easily have been earning that much. I hope he isn't another Freddy Adu.

##### Super Bowl

Gronk likes a peanut butter and jelly sarnie along with some chocolate milk before a game, proving that it really is America's game.

I can't wait for Sunday..... Well Monday night actually as I am having a party at my mates house. I just hope I can make it through the day with no-one telling me the score.
