This is was more like a pre-season game. There were no changing rooms so we changed by the side of the pitch. Which was a problem as it was in a park with children playing merrily in a playground nearby. No changing room meant no showers after the game, [talk about stank](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0664520/quotes) when I got home. The ground was rock solid, my feet were sore and my toe nails were hurting, it was hot which meant just about everybody on the team was knackered by the hour mark.

I was going to write about the changing room habits of some of our players this week, but obviously the lack of a changing room scuppered my plans. This time we sat on the ground and listened to Kyle and Dave rip it out of each other. Dave is proud of the fact that he is half German and lets us all know it, although we rinse him because he looks like [Ron Vlaar.](http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/01556/vlaar_1556154a.jpg)

I won the toss and chose to play into the wind first half, they kicked off and the first pass from their midfielder was overhit and went out for a throw-in. I gave him a little tap on the back 'Auspicous start mate.' He gave a shake of his head and muttered 'This is our first game of the season, don't know what I'm doing here.' Leicester Three Lions are a new team in our league and wanted to play us in a friendly, I guess to size us up when we play them later in the season. On this showing we should take six points off them, as long as we can put out a half decent side.

Kyle has moved to centre back which has given us a lot of ammunition for taking the piss, from top scorer last season to centre back. He's also given us pace at the back which allows him to recover from his iffy positioning. His hefty presence will add a steeliness to our defence and I have never seen him head the ball so much, he headed the ball more times this game than the whole of last season. We took the lead after a terrible mix up between their goalie and defender which meant our player had an open goal to pass the ball into. If the new players Ellis, Alex and Taha stay and if we can keep Biddles fit we should be strong going forward. The problem we are going to have is shape, especially when we lose the ball which means we will struggle defensively. Part of the problem is that our wingers stay too far up the pitch when we lose the ball, they need to work harder to get back into position.

I have been encouraged from our two pre-season games, we have passed the ball really well at times instead of hitting it long. If we can do that more I think we will be a hard team to beat and we should enjoy it more too.

They were a feisty lot with short tempers, their striker kicked out at Kyle after he confronted him for deliberately booting the ball at our left-back who was lying prone on the ground. I had put my hands on their centre midfielder after a dirty challenge and their centre back got involved saying he was going to deck me. It should make for a fun couple of games with them over the season. As I have grown in confidence I now relish the physical challenge of the game whereas a couple of seasons ago I would have shied away from it. The final score was four two and we could easily have scored more and they faded badly in the second half when their lack of fitness showed.

##### The Ashes

I still can't get over that first innings score of sixty. My memory of Australian cricket is of it absolutely battering us over 15 years, we were so poor it was embarrassing. It was always a procession for Australia and everytime England started to get into a game we scuppered our chances with the inevitable collapse. We lost the 2001 Ashes in eleven days. I didn't think I would live to see the day that England won back the Ashes. It looks like we are going to have won the Ashes in England for a decade, which is something I could never have foreseen ten years ago.

Australia's batting has been atrocious they keep giving their wickets away playing ridiculously attacking shots. Steve Smith keeps on trying smash the ball out the ground and dominate the bowling, he doesn't just want to be positive he is trying to attack at all times. Apart from the Lord's test he has failed everytime with the bat, which is worrying for Australia. Especially as he hasn't reigned in his batting, you would have thought he would have realised he needs to change the way he plays on green wickets. Unless there is an incredible turn around in their second innings I think Australia are done for, however I do feel like England threw away a lot of their wickets on day two.

##### NFL Pre-season is finally here

At least the players get to put on their pads and bash into each other, except for the qb of course. The news coming out of the Bucs camp is of Winston throwing lots of picks which is what he did at college, so no surprise there. Mariota has had it easy, no picks yet and not much media attention compared to Winston, which I am sure he likes. I know it is early but those interceptions are worrying, did they take the wrong guy? Only time will tell. I reckon Winston will amass passing yards this year, as I expect them to be in losing positions so he will have to throw it more to his very talented receiver corps.

Oh Aldon Smith. Can you please, please stay out of trouble for a few weeks. His latest [mishap](http://deadspin.com/aldon-smith-arrested-for-dui-hit-and-run-vandalism-1722691465) has brought to an end his career as a Niner? What a waste of such incredible talent, it's a shame, a crying shame.
