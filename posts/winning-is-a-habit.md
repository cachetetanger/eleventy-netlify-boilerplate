They say winning is a habit, a habit which we in Park End have not experienced very often. In Park End's previous two seasons we have played 44 games won 13, drew 5 lost 26 with a goal difference of minus sixty. Which seems pretty poor but when you compare it to the minus one hundred and eight of Burbage or minus one hundred and twelve of Kibworth, it makes us look like Arsenal under George Graham. This season we have won four games on the bounce including one in the County Cup and now have a goal difference of plus thirteen and if we win our next game we will go top of the [league](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp6gaB-YmVA). What is going on? Well for one we now have good players and are dangerous going forward which takes pressure off the defence. My worry is that the teams expectations will change and we will fall apart if we start to lose. Always the pessimist. Dave scored again today so now he is ahead of me in the goal stakes, although his goal took a massive deflection, it should have gone down as an own goal.

This week I found out that we play in the sixteenth tier of English football, which means that I could play in the Premier League before my fiftieth birthday. I think that deserves the hashtag daretobelieve.

Liverpool are finding out that it is not easy to progress as a team when you sell your best player and then use the money (plus more) to stock your squad with supposedly good players. Tottenham struggled last season and are only now seemingly able to move forward, it will probably be a similar story for Liverpool. Chelsea are ridiculously good at the moment and Fabregas is looking good for player of the season, although Costa will probably get it.

Chargers won again. Philip Rivers almost perfect even without a running game, although the team need Mathews back if we are to carry on winning. What has happened to Brady and the Patriots, I haven't watched any of their games yet this season, but they look poor. Gronk will probably improve as the season progresses and I still think they will make the playoffs.
