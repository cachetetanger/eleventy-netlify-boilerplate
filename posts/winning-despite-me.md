Travelling from Zambia to Leicester in nearly thirty hours and then trying to play a game of football isn't ideal. I cramped up a bit towards the end of the first half and ten minutes into the second half I could no longer run and had to be substituted.

We were up against Kibworth and scored the fastest goal in a game I have played in. They kicked-off, the striker passed to the centre midfielder who passed to the central defender who took a heavy touch, our striker picked up the ball and placed it past the onrushing keeper. ONE NIL. Blink and you would have missed it. It was strange having the kick-off again so soon, some sort of glitch in [The Matrix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_KmNZNT5xw) without the black cat. Days like this on a football pitch are to savour, we won every fifty fifty, the loose balls fell to us and I had lots of time in the middle to pick a pass. We were cruising and went into halftime five nil up. I scored the third, a corner whipped into the backpost went over my head, Dave took a poor touch, the ball fell to me and I lashed it into the top corner. Which means I now have one goal in two games compared to Dave's one in three, perhaps I will win the goal competition after all.

The final score was seven one and it was every bit as one-sided as Germany Brazil at the World Cup. It leaves us third in the table, I'm used to being third from bottom. The difference from last season is that Pete is playing regularly and we have the two James, both are good players. Especially the James who we don't call Stephen, it helps us from getting confused. Along with those two we also have a few other young ones who are like Scrappy Doo. They are fearless and have legs that don't stop running. They definitely [carry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzkLSUsWuhg) Dave and I in midfield. If we can keep the group of players for the whole season we could well finish near the top of the table.

The less said about Spurs losing to West Brom the better, but hey at least we can beat Forest. Next up Arsenal.

On returning to England I was suprised to see that the Chargers had beaten the Seahawks. Which meant I missed out on giving my brother who lives in Seattle a ribbing.

How much power does the NFL wield over sport's networks? Quite a lot it would seem. They are able to get Bill Simmons suspended for three weeks for speaking the truth. I suppose this is the way of modern sport, money and trying to protect your false image.
