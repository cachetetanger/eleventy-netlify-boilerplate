5 times.

I have mended punctures on my back tyre 5 times in the last week and only ridden my bike once. And that wasn't a proper ride, no sooner had I sat on my bike when I heard a loud hissing sound emanating from the back tyre. It made me late for work that day.

I got a new pump for Christmas, one of the ones which are standing up and have a pressure gauge on them. It has given me the impetus to fix my bike and my children's bikes, I even pumped up a flat car tyre.

As the boys' bikes are now fixed we've been on rides to the park. They are too young to have watched BMX Bandits but as I run alongside them I imagine them getting into scrapes and being knight-errants together. Asher is a tour de force on his bike, he loves going fast and is away as soon as he is out the front door. Caleb stoutly follows after, with me steadying him regularly as his feet barely reach the ground. He also looks at his pedals, it helps him to pedal smoothly, he looks up periodically and calls after Asher to wait. On a gentle downward slope he motors along and on a gentle incline I periodically propel him forward with a gentle shove. The outing to the park used to take us at least half an hour, now they are back home within 15 minutes.

I took Asher to school on my bike, he sat on the seat and held onto my shoulders while I pushed it with my hands on the handlebars. He pretended to be a knight all the way to school. Once I'd dropped him off, I sat on my bike and waited for the hissing noise to begin.

Nothing.

The patch was doing its job.

Off I went.

My first bike ride for a month. I felt this joy at being able to cycle, the wind in my face as I picked up speed, the slight burn in my diminished quads.

Playing.

The hours I spent on my BMX, the ridiculously named Loose Goose, as a boy came flooding back to me. Riding round the neighbourhood with my friends, setting up ramps to [jump](https://youtu.be/99sP75fJa9c?t=73) over them. I would count how many jumps I could do on the way to school, or pretend it was a motorbike and twist the right grip on the handlebar as if it was the accelerator......whilst making a brrrmmm noise.

It is a dream to go on a bike holiday in France and ride up some of the famous climbs from the Tour. I imagine the warm weather and me flying up a winding road surrounded by pine forests and snowy mountain peaks. This pleasant delusion is shattered when I start to suffer on the way home from work. Today I was cycling back from Loughborough after a long day of digging. I was empty, even the Cornish pasty I'd had at lunch didn't seem to be helping. It was dark, my shadow hypnotically glided by and stretched out every street lamp I passed. I was in a trance, revolution after revolution brought me closer, my pain increased, my gear decreased. I was well and truly bonking.
