I thought I would start this post with a completely unrelated story to anything else I am going to write about. I bought a roof box for my car and when I was doing research for it, it dawned on me that I can no longer consider myself young, I am officially middle aged. I also have a white hair in my beard, it stands out and I have been meaning to cut it but haven't got round to it.

Moving swiftly on...

I mentioned last week that kick offs have been moved forward half an hour so that we aren't playing in the dark towards the end of the game. This week the issue was the sun, it was a gloriously warm day(as if a winter's day in this country is ever warm) and the sun was out. The sun was low in the sky when we kicked off and as the game wore on it got lower, it ended up being a deciding factor. The elements counted against us when we lost 10-3 and we didn't learn our lesson. We played with the sun at our backs in the first half, we won the toss and should have chosen to kick the other way but decided to have the ball at kick off. We started with a 451 formation with Pete up top by himself, when they had possession Dan our self appointed coach told us not to press until they got into our half. We were containing them pretty well but were unable to get forward quick enough to support Pete and when we needed a bit of composure on the ball we invariably hit it long. This meant Pete was chasing lost causes and isolated if he did get the ball. We went behind when they got a freekick on the edge of our area. Rule number one with opposition freekick's is to have someone stand on the ball so they can't take it quickly. We didn't do that and as Heath was arranging the wall their player took it and all of us watched in surprise as it went in.

We then went berserk at the referee for allowing him to take it quickly.

You feel cheated when it happens against you, [think Chelsea in 2004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCWjioIR5MM) and you want someone to blame even though the ref was right in this case and we were undone by our own naivety.

We changed to a 442 after that and put Kyle up front with Pete, it meant that Dave and I had to work a little harder in the middle but we were a lot more dangerous going forward and the game was no longer being played in our half. We equalised when Rafa our Chilean import who is a tidy player, won the ball in their half evaded a cynical challenge from their central defender and played in Kyle. Watching Kyle in front of goal is a bit like watching Heath in goal, it fills you with dread. The expectation isn't that he will hit it straight at the keeper or shoot wide but that he will fall over the ball. It looked like he was going to do that again but he somehow got the ball out from under his feet and finished neatly past the keeper. We soon went 2-1 up when Pete was put through and then fouled, the ball came to Kyle who had an open goal. He took a touch and their defenders got back and we all thought that he was going to fluff it but he managed to tuck it away in the corner of the goal. We were good for the lead and were playing better since we changed formation, they were finding it difficult to stop Pete. He gets lumps kicked out of him everytime he plays and at this level the referees don't do enough to stop it. Just before halftime he was running towards their box with only one defender to beat, he knocked it past the defender who took him out cynically.

The ref gave a goal kick.

Pete was fuming and let the ref know. The frustration from all the times he gets fouled was coming out. He has said before that it only takes one bad tackle for someone to break his leg. He needs the ref more than most to keep tackles in check.

As I mentioned already we had the sun in our eyes for the second half, which meant that any long ball was hard for our defenders to see. Their equaliser came from a counter attack, we had a throw in by their box which they cleared over the halfway line. It would have been an easy header for Grundy but he shouted 'I can't see anything!' The ball went over his head there was a neat little interchange between their two strikers which led to a tap in. There wasn't a lot to say about it, if you can't see the ball you can't see the ball.

From the ensuing kick off Pete must have thought he was playing FIFA. He just started running towards their goal, he rode three challenges before he was absolutely nailed by a cynical tackle. Their player had no intention of trying to win the ball. Pete stayed down holding his ankle and both sets of players came together in the way footballers do. A bit of shoving and a lot of swearing. The ref only gave a yellow and Pete's day was done, he damaged his ligaments and will probably be out for a couple of months. Dave and I helped him off the pitch and Dave said 'Don't worry Pete he will be leaving on a stretcher.'

A few minutes later the player who had fouled Pete knocked the ball past Dave who wellied him. Cue more players pushing each other and swearing lots. The ref called Dave over and I jogged back to the edge of our box to defend the freekick. I turned around to see Dave walking off the pitch.

A straight red.

You can't be dishing out vigilante justice on a football pitch and he had to go, but the guy Dave kicked wasn't hurt whereas Pete could barely walk. It felt unfair to us although it ended in a win win situation for them. That meant we had to play the last twenty five minutes with ten men. We played really well, Heath made a couple of decent saves but in the end they couldn't create enough and we held on. There was a massive sense of relief at the final whistle and I celebrated like [the Aussies at Old Trafford in 2005,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Mu3Sy5Mazk#t=797) I kept it all inside of course. As I had been subbed I was dying to get into the changing room because I was freezing.

The silver lining from Pete's injury? I got to drive his car home. It was a bit of beast, never driven anything as quick as it before. I would put my foot down in second gear and the car would just take off. His [Renault Clio](http://cdn1.carbuyer.co.uk/sites/carbuyer_d7/files/jato_uploaded/Renault-Clio-Renaultsport-200-hatchback-2012-front-quarter-main.jpg) definitely beat my [Renault Clio.](http://uk.imglocalmart.com/image/main/M7T02AYdeMzaZSyh)

##### Week 15 in the NFL

I guess we have to start with Manziel. What a disastrous debut.

Destroyed.

He made so many mistakes and looked like a college player. I know he is a rookie but he has got a lot of work to do if he is to make it in the NFL. I can't see him doing his money sign celebration anytime soon but I think we will be seeing plenty more of it from [opposing players.](http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014121404/2014/REG15/bengals@browns#menu=drivechart|contentId%3A0ap3000000443652&tab=videos) On a serious note, where do Cleveland go from here, if I was a Cleveland fan I would be devastated.

The Chargers do what the Chargers do best. They flatter to deceive. They started the season strongly but it looks like our season is running out of steam. We couldn't keep their offense off the field and you can't miss easy field goals. Playing catch up is not what you want to be doing against any team let alone Denver. Lets see if we can get something from the San Francisco game.

Fans and journalists love to crown people and teams before the season is over. 'The road to the Super Bowl is through Green Bay', similarly in the Premier League the title race was over a few weeks ago because Chelsea had already won the league. Green Bay lose and Rodgers throws two picks and now they are no longer first in their division. There is a tendency to use hyperbole when talking about teams or players, I definitely do, but it is funny how quickly our opinions can change. Even after this loss I still think Green Bay are one of the favourites for the Super Bowl, but for some reason they are no longer the shoo-in they never were in the first place.

Cutler had a bad game, which is now normal and has been benched for the game against Detroit. Chicago are in a bind as they have staked their franchise on him being the [guy.](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-possibly-intriguing-nfl-qb-trade-market/) Unless they can convince a team to take him in a trade they will be paying him a lot of money over the coming seasons.

##### The other type of football highlights

Tottenham continue to look unconvincing. We are winning, but more worrying we are rarely the best team on the day. I think expectations are pretty low, we will probably finish between fifth and eighth and at the moment I can't say we deserve much better. It is good to see Mason and Bentaleb starting in the midfield, along with Kane that makes three players from our academy in the starting lineup.

Liverpool lostand were poor, they can't have many complaints about the result. Man Utd don't know how to defend but as long as De Gea stays in this form they can't be counted out of the title yet.

I don't have a game until the January so have a Merry Christmas and see you in the New Year.
