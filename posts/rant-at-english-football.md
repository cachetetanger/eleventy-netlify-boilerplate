It is more than a little depressing being an English football fan. Actually, I am not a fan of England anymore and haven't been for a long time. This feeling of being let down by England stems from the 2002 World Cup. Losing the way we did to Brazil was pitiful. Tactically we are so inept, there is an inability to move the ball around with pace. Sitting back and letting the other team have the ball and hoping to score a quick breakaway goal or from a dead ball situation is not going to win us anything. It has been like this for over a decade and yet there hasn't been a change. The manner of defeats in the big tournaments has taken away from the fact that tactically England are inferior to most of the teams they play. The heartbreak of penalties against Portugal twice and Italy is what people remember, not that England were second best on the night. Losing when taking the game to the opposition you could forgive. Tell me if this rings a bell, England take the lead and then start to defend deeper and deeper. Everytime they get the ball they play it long to a lone striker who surrenders possession because he has no support. I have seen it happen so many times over the years and it makes me want to throw my TV out the window, especially as we are meant to have world class players. Tony Adams wrote a great [article](http://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/23/worldcupfootball2002.sport17) about the manner of our defeat to Brazil, read it and let me know if anything has changed?

He wrote it over ten years ago......
