It blew me away. You know the phrase 'sitting on the edge of your seat', well I actually was. I genuinely was. My shoulders ached after the film because I had been tensing them so much.

Go watch Mad Max Fury Road.

You won't be disappointed and you will understand the references to Imperator Furiosa, witness, People Eater, 'I had a baby brother and he was perfect in everyway', Aqua Cola, Nux, mother's milk, guzzoline, Valhalla, 'I live I die I live again', Doof Warrior, Bullet Farm, Breeders, high octane crazy blood, The Green Place, polecats, War Boys, flamers, [Shiny and Chrome](http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-710-5521-Silver-Color-Mist/dp/B005KTVG86/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8), Gas Town, Larry and Barry, tree thing, blood bag.

Just go watch it.
