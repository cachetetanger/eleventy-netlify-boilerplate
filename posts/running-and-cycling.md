This time of year is when I start to exercise more and set myself unrealistic goals I'm never going to achieve over the coming months. I have started to run regularly again and have in mind entering the Leicester Half-Marathon. My aim is to run it in one hour thirty, which is quite quick and I have a training schedule to get me ready to do it in that time. However I haven't signed up for it and my enthusiasm is already waning. Running a half-marathon in that time takes effort with a lot of suffering and pain.

Do I not like that.

I am at a critical point, if I sign up soon I will continue to push myself otherwise my running will peter out once winter comes.

My running running habit is opposite to one of my best mates, he stops running during the summer but steps it up for winter. It's because he gets so hot running in the summer that he reminds me of an old banger with steam coming out of its bonnet halfway up a hill. Those cold clear winter nights are his favourite times to run, they keep him from overheating.

First it was tennis when Wimbledon was on and now it's cycling because of the Tour de France. I went for a relatively gentle bike ride last week, just shy of thirty miles with Tim and Jules. It was a beautiful summer evening and we headed east of Leicester past Stoughton and the airfield to the countryside. As we meandered along quiet country roads we passed fields of golden wheat, church spires and startled hares. We kept a leisurely pace which allowed us to take in the scenery and carry on a conversation.

We hadn't planned a route which meant we ended up on the A47 after leaving Billesdon. I jumped in fright when an undercover police car zoomed by with lights flashing and siren blaring.

It was a Porsche.

I bet there are arguments about who gets to drive it.

A lorry also drove by as we were plodding up a hill, I expected the draught to blow me over instead I felt the heat of the engine and got a mouthful of diesel fumes. That was the only unpleasant part of the ride.

As we headed back home past the airfield again we spooked a deer in a field of wheat and it ran parallel to us for fifty metres. It was a majestic end to a wonderful bike ride. All that remained was to award The Speedy Gonzales t-shirt to the days best bike rider. This week it went to Jules for his speedy descent down one of the hills which Tim and I couldn't compete with.
