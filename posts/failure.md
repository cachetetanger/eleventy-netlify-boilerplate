Failure weighs me down.  
It stops me doing what I want to do.

I have been having a tough week with depression and feelings of failure, these things are my companions that I carry with me everywhere. At the moment they have faded from the forefront of my mind and I am doing well....for now.

##### Other thoughts from this week

The Ducks lost in Game 7 along with my hopes of having watched the eventual Stanley Cup Champions.

In my last post I said Blatter would probably survive this scandal, wrong again. Just about all my predictions are wrong, I need to stop.

I am so so so pleased that the new Point Break film looks terrible, just watch the trailer.

Compared to the original I will use the immortal words of Bear ["It's just the lemon next to the pie."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFvY_meM_n8) The original is one of my favourite films of all time and on hearing that they were re-making it I was hoping it would be rubbish.

I am off to watch [Mad Max Fury Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEJnMQG9ev8) tomorrow night, which I am very excited about. It looks epic and the lack of CGI is refreshing, it won't follow the prescribed formula of most Hollywood Blockbusters. Also I managed to get 2for1 tickets for a whole year through Meerkat Movies, to qualify I bought a days travel insurance for Â£2.03. Chuffed!

Nick Hardwick has slimmed down a lot and I mean a lot, supposedly just from eating less.

Football season is over again, I didn't see the Champions League final so won't comment on it. I will try to fill the blog up with a few different pieces over the summer.
