The cheapest ticket meant our flight left Heathrow at 6am which in turn meant we left Leicester at 2am. I thought it was going to be a nightmare journey with the kids screaming, however they both travelled really well. Asher was so excited to go on an aeroplane that he stayed awake nearly the whole journey to the airport, falling asleep just as we got off the motorway. Â We had packed the night before, Caitlyn wanted to bring three suitcases which I thought was excessive. So in a passive protest I packed 2 pairs of boxers, a pair shorts, 3 t-shirts, 2 long sleeved tops and flip flops as well as the socks, shoes, trousers, boxers, t-shirt and a jumper I wore on the flight.

Needless to say it didn't work, we still brought three suitcases.

We got to the airport at 4am, it was quiet and we went through security smoothly. I am often quite anxious before flights and I want to make sure we arrive with plenty of time to spare this includes making it to the gate punctually. This anxiety takes away some of the fun of travelling so I was consciously slowing myself down, allowing myself to enjoy the moment.

In Madrid we didn't get our pushchair and had to ask for it to be sent on to Tangier, but other than that the flights went smoothly. The notable thing about the flight to Tangier was how the Spanish pronounce it, they say Tan-kha which sounds so wrong. I fell asleep before we had left the ground and was woken by the bump when we touched down in Morocco.

It is hard to describe the feeling of being back in Morocco, I spent the first 10 years of my life there and it brings back a lot of memories and emotions from my childhood. One time after getting off the ferry in Tangier I got down on my hands and knees and kissed the ground much to the bemusement of those around me. The terminal smelt of stale cigarette smoke and felt a bit too grand for its purpose which is often the case with public building in Morocco. Smells brought memories flooding back to me, in many ways it felt like I was coming home. We got our bags and picked up our hire car, my parents were there to meet us and we followed them to my grandma's house. My Grandpa built it in the 60s on some land given to him by a grateful patient, at the time it was on a hill outside the city, the house was a tranquil hideaway from the busyness of life and he christened it The Cachette. Over the years Tangier has grown and now the Cachette is part of a very upmarket neighbourhood overlooking the city, on this trip I found out our neighbour is the King's uncle.

After dropping our bags off at the Cachette we drove into Tangier and parked near the English church, the gate to the garden was locked but I could peer over the top of it and see my great grandmothers' gravestones. It was a poignant moment in the midst of the hustle and bustle and I attracted a few stares from passers-by. We made our way through the Grand Socco which gave Asher a chance to run and stretch his legs after the long day of travel. We continued into the souq and dad bought some olives for later, we stopped to rest at a point where we could see the port. The ferry from Algeciras used to arrive here, which made it really easy to get to the Cachette, now it arrives at a new port 25 miles east along the coast.

In the morning we went to a cafe for breakfast, I had my first coffee and petit pain of the trip. One thing that has changed since I've been here in the last two years is that every cafe has free wifi. My sister and her husband arrived that afternoon from the States, my parents went to the new port to pick them up. It gave us a few hours to relax in the Cachette and enjoy the sunshine. Asher explored the garden, he found some sticks to hit things with, which only became a problem when he directed them at me. It was great seeing my sister and her family, we saw them over new year when we were skiing in [Schweitzer.](http://thecroggy.com/christmas-holiday/) After dinner at the Cachette we all headed to bed as we were driving to Marrakech the following day. I was woken in the night when Asher who was sleeping on a mat, rolled under our bed and woke up in a panic as he was stuck, to be fair I would have freaked out too, he ended up sleeping in our bed the rest of the night.

We left after breakfast and headed out of Tangier through new neighbourhoods on wide boulevards that led to the motorway, we stopped at a petrol station and picked up some snacks and drinks for the road. When I was young there weren't any motorways in Morocco and it took us a long time to get anywhere, now it is really straightforward. The motorways have tolls like in France and Spain, they are quick and well maintained. The only thing I don't like about driving in Morocco are the speed traps, Gendarme sneakily hide in places where you cannot see them waiting to catch you speeding. It means you can never really switch off and have to keep an eye on your speed at all times.

Marrakech is a sprawling city of around a million people and the lights of it can be seen from miles away, it alerts you to its presence long before you are there. To get into the centre you drive along wide boulevards with brand new buildings and bright cafes with flashy neon signs. We were trying to make it to the Djemaa El-Fna, it turned into a rubbish party as I couldn't see the road signs clearly because it was dark and there was so much traffic. My parents and and sister were following me in their cars but I ended up losing them. After a few pointless phone calls trying to work out how to meet up again we decided to call again once we had found a place to park near the Djemaa El-Fna. It turned out I wasn't too far off from the square and once I got there I found a place on a street where an assass ripped me off, I couldn't get him to lower the price as it was a holiday in Morocco and Marrakech was packed. We unloaded the car and put Asher in the pushchair and Caitlyn had Caleb in the carrier and we headed to the square to wait for the others. The square was choc-a-bloc with groups of people standing around the story tellers and entertainers, a smoky haze hung above the food stalls and they gave out the enticing smell of barbecued meat and the whiny drone of the snake charmers flutes added to the atmosphere.

![Djemaa El Fna](images/djema-el-fna.jpg)

My family eventually turned up and we trooped across the square into the souq to our riad, we looked like a rag tag bunch, weary after a long days travel pulling our suitcases behind us. It was a only a short walk and we turned off the main drag into a narrow alley, soon after we stopped at a nondescript door, our host opened it for us and we entered into a different world. The noise from the square was gone and we were inside a beautifully renovated riad, with original wood beams and doors still in place.

![Door to our bedroom](images/old-door.jpg)

We put the kids straight to bed and then went onto the roof to chat and wind down, it was warm on the roof and the sound of the square could be heard faintly in the distance. We headed to bed after a good catch up with my sister and husband as we hadn't really had a chance since they arrived.

In the morning the maid brought breakfast of rghaif, petit pains, fresh orange juice, coffee and mint tea. Childhood memories came flooding back of breakfasts in cafes in Oujda as I sat down to eat.

![breakfast](images/breakfast.jpg)

We spent the day idly pottering about the souq without any haste or sense of urgency. It was really enjoyable, stopping in a few shops talking to some locals. The further away from the Djemaa El-Fna we got the quieter it became and the shopkeepers were generally friendlier. It started to get very warm and carrying little ones on our backs soon began to take its toll so we headed back to the riad for lunch and a rest.

![caitlyn and asher](images/caitlyn-and-asher.jpg)

Asher played in the pool on the roof of the riad whilst I sat and read and tried unsuccessfully to not get soaked by him. We ate dinner at one of the stalls in the square, it was not a particularly enjoyable experience. I have eaten there a couple of times and it has always been the same, each stall has a number of workers who aggressively try to get you to eat at their stall. Once we settled on one they hurriedly took our order, trying to speed us up. The food when it came was not very nice, the quality of the grilled meat was really poor and the portions were small. The final bill came to 650 dirhams which was a complete rip-off. The only enjoyable memory I have of the evening is trying to wake Asher so he could eat, it was so hard and he kept on falling asleep, it was really cute.

The following morning we drove the three hours to Essaouira which is on the Atlantic coast. It has a very laid back feel, especially compared to Marrakech and the city has grown massively since I was last there over a decade ago. There are now hotels stretching along the beach, to be fair to the city planners they haven't allowed them to be built too tall, which means you don't feel that these behemoth hotels are watching over you.

![fishing boat](images/fishing-boat.jpg)

The port is one of my favourite places, they still bring in the catch on their blue fishing boats everyday. There is a hive of activity with people selling their fish on small stalls. You have these wonderful fresh fish lined up on a small amount of ice which is melting quickly under the blazing sun. You can feel the sense of urgency as buyers and sellers are frantically trying to sell and transport their wares before they spoil. Throughout the port you see fishermen mending nets and adding bait to hooks as well as young boys cleaning the boats.

![essaouira walls](images/essaouira-walls.jpg)

Essaouira was the sight of a Portuguese fort and has beautiful old walls facing the sea. We walked through the mellah, which has fallen into disrepair, there are big open spaces where houses used to stand. There were two synagogues that were open to the public and a number of houses had stars of David on their door frames. You wouldn't think that Morocco had much of a Jewish history but there was a sizeable population until the 50s and 60s. An interesting fact is that the King's most trusted advisor is a Jew and Morocco generally has good relations with Israel. The Israeli border stamp in my passport hasn't caused me any problems when I've entered the country on two previous occasions.

![essaouira](images/essaouira.jpg)

We spent a couple of very relaxing days here, the only bad moment being when Asher threw up in front of a couple of cafes in the main square, making me enjoy our meal in the Djmaaa El-Fna even less, if that was possible. We did get ripped off by one shop keeper who was drunk and who I should have waleked away from. Caitlyn and I ended up drinking tea with him and we wanted to leave but his manipulative skills which I knew he was doing still sucked me in.

Grrrrr.

Shame on me for letting myself fall for them and not being strong enough to walk out.

We drove to Sefrou where my brother has a house, it was a pretty uneventful drive a long the motorway for most of the way. Sefrou was the first place we had rain on the trip, the weather had been wonderful up until then. Sefrou is a dishevelled small market town which serves the villages in the surrounding hills and it has a rather seedy mellah. I was with my brother when he bought the house just over ten years ago, it was a rather run down decrepit house with a poky staircase leading up three floors and a rooftop that is the highest in town. He has spent the last decade and tens of thousands of pounds restoring it and it was the first time I'd been back. He has done an incredible job restoring it and now you can even [stay there.](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/6241122?s=pK3UAZKO)

We headed to Fes the following day and even though I had prepared myself for my dad getting us lost on the drive to the medina qaddima I still found myself getting incredibly frustrated with him when he inevitably did get lost. We eventually parked up near Bab Boujloud and met up with an old friend of ours who we had grown up with in Morocco. My mum had never been into the medina before which made it special to be able to share this experience with her. You basically walk downhill towards the centre of the medina, the main drain gets narrower and narrower with many smaller alleys leading off it. Every now and then you get to a fork and have to make a decision as to which route to take, they have put up a lot of signs showing the way to landmarks which is a new and handy addition to the experience. It means you no longer worry at forks in the road about which route to take, whereas before it was very easy to become hopelessly lost.

![bab bou joloud](images/bab-bou-joloud.jpg)

There are so many shops and the quality of the goods is really high with most of them made in Fes by local artisans. A steady supply of donkeys, carts and motorbikes carrying raw materials along the narrow alleys keep the craftsmen supplied. Cries of 'Balaak!' let you know a cart or donkey is coming, meaning you have to squeeze to one side of the alley to let it past, sometimes you wonder how they make it because they are so overloaded. One thing I love about Morocco is you can stop in the middle of the pavement or in this case the alley, meaning people walking by have to make their way round you and it's perfectly acceptable. Imagine in England a group of people clogging up a pavement, people would ask you to move out the way, in Morocco there is none of that, they just walk around you.

![babouche](images/babouche.jpg)

We didn't get too close to the tannery this time, which is good as it stinks, normally the shopkeeper has a bunch of mint and he will hand you a sprig to hold upto your nose as you overlook them. As you go down into the centre of the medina you start to hear the noise of the craftsmen working away, whether it is the ringing of hammers on metal, or wood being cut or looms making carpets, you feel you have reached the beating heart of the medina. Caitlyn and I wanted to buy a lamp for our hallway but we couldn't find one at a price we were willing to pay. It pained us to have to leave some of them behind, just look at how beautiful these are.

![lamps](images/lamps.jpg)

We found a place that made kifta sandwiches stuffed with chips and ate them on the hoof as we labouriously made our way back up to Bab Boujloud. A few minutes earlier we had received a desperate call from my dad, who not wanting to go into the medina and had offered to take Asher and my nephew to a park instead, he'd now reached his limit. By the time we made it back to them we were all rather weary after being on our feet for the previous three hours, although my dad looked more worn out than any of us.

We said goodbye to my family and headed to Al Hoceima, I met Caitlyn there ten years earlier and we wanted to go back and see it as well as get in a visit with some friends who live there. We took the road to Ketama instead of the usual route through Taza and Kassita. The road we took led us right through the centre of the kif growing region with Ketama being the hub. I had heard stories of people driving on the road being stopped by other cars attempting to sell them hash but didn't experience it the only time I drove the road a few years previously. Soon after leaving Fes the road started to make it's way up through the foothills of the Rif mountains, they were green from spring rains. The contrast of the hillsides further east was stark, they were brown barren slopes with hardly any greenery. Once we got into the mountains proper I had a number of cars following me closely flashing their lights trying to get me to stop. One of them a Mercedes pulled alongside me and the passenger waved a big packet of hash wrapped in clingfilm at me out his window. He pulled off the road ahead of me and I drove right by. It wasn't scary as such but it made me a little uneasy, it felt like a darker and neglected part of Morocco. The road surface added to those ominous feelings, it reminded me of the Morocco I knew growing up. It was windy, uneven, potholed and very narrow and in a number of places the road surface had been washed away and you had to go very slowly over what remained. We made it to Al Hoceima without buying any hash or crashing and had a good couple of days with our friends before heading back to Tangier along the new road that follows the Mediterranean coast. Our final day in Tangier we hung out at the Cachette with family and tried to soak in our final Moroccan night.

Morocco is in my blood and it is such a huge part of my story, there is an old familiarity to the place a bit like a grandparent's house, where different rooms are associated with different memories. I love the language and it comes back to me after a few days of being back and I love learning new phrases and words. It is amazing how much it has changed in the last ten years, it does feel like a giant building site. There were countless diversions on the roads because they were improving or [adding](http://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2015/03/152889/highest-suspension-bridge-africa-built-rabat/) to the existing roads. All this investment in infrastructure will only add to the attractiveness of investing in Morocco, however the government must create more jobs and opportunities for people here, otherwise we could see the resentment build to a level which leads to the type of protests that have happened all over the Arab world in the last few years.
