There have been moments in my life where I have given up completely and let myself go, I am currently in the middle of one of those times. I am not sure what has triggered it, but the idea of going for a run or doing any exercise for that matter is beyond me, all I want to do is eat fruit loops from a big bowl and sit on the sofa all day. Motivation has slipped and it won't be long before I end up looking like [Roy Anderson.](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7njld0k3X1qd90k3o1_400.jpg) There are plus sides to this melancholia, firstly I eat a lot and secondly I have been able to watch the first three series of The Office, the American version, which is better than the original.

We can't get a win at the moment. We have lost five on the bounce and desperation is setting in. I didn't play last weekend but we lost 5-3 to Glen Villa. We were 3 nil down at half time but a better second half. Getting lumps kicked out of us by Birstall knocked our confidence and we need a win to boost it. A good performance would help as well, but a win will stop the rot and get us through this tough stretch. Tomorrow we play Forest East who are 3 points above us in the league.

Now that it has turned cold it hurts to kick a ball during warm up because my toes are so freezing. Our kickoff time has moved forward half an hour, but in our game two weeks ago the last ten minutes were played as dusk descended. I wouldn't have been able to see the ball if we had played on for a few more minutes. When you first leave the changing room it is quite miserable, but I find half time worse. You soon start to freeze as the sweat on your body does what it is meant to do and cools you down. Sometimes I think it would be better to go without halftime and just play straight through, because my teeth are chattering by the end of it and I am afraid I might end up like [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=AYCwIxdSRQs#t=118) (Caveat: I have never asked a team mate to pee on me to warm me up).

A quick look at the NFL this weeks shows the pressure is cranking up in Cleveland, I tweeted that Hoyer would have a good game against the Colts.

Uh, got that one horribly wrong.

Starting Manziel is what everybody is clamouring for, however I am not sure it is such a good idea. This article by [Fran Tarkenton](http://mmqb.si.com/2014/12/05/nfl-fran-tarkenton-adrian-peterson-ray-rice-robert-griffin-iii-rg3/) has a lot of insight into what it takes to be a top QB in the NFL. He says the most important thing is to prepare well, ie study your arse off and secondly you have to be a good passer. Now I am not saying Manziel isn't studying hard or that he isn't a good passer, but because of his athleticism he is more inclined to use that than work on his fundamentals. Look at RGIII, he was outstanding his rookie year but since his injuries he has lost his mobility and everyone can see he does not possess the basic attributes to be a QB in the NFL.

To be fair to Manziel, he has kept a low profile since the season started and apart from one altercation that probably wasn't his fault his attitude has been what the team would have hoped for. I hope Manziel succeeds in the NFL and this Sunday he his chance to prove himself. As with RGIII all it takes is one injury and he could be done.

Another interesting thing in the Fran Tarkenton article is what he has to say about PEDs. "You look at some of the guys who played these physical positions, they are shadows of their former selves one year or two years after they get out of football. They lost 40, 50, 60 pounds. Is that normal? I’m 74 years old. I played at a weight of 193. I wasn’t on PEDs, and I now weigh 192. But I fight not to weigh 220. When you retire, historically, you put on weight."  
The NFL does not give a shit about PEDs in the sport and is happy for the occasional player who gets caught to claim it was Adderall. It's a load of bollocks and everyone knows it but no-one within the sport is willing to take responsibility for it.

How the mighty have fallen. Seattle versus 49ers a rematch of last season's NFC Championship Game. Seahawks look to be back to their mean stingy selves on defense and Russel Wilson continues to manage the offense well enough to win games. Whereas the 49ers have imploded this season, the team is in complete disarray and it looks like Jim Harbaugh tenure is coming to an end. Kaepernick is short of confidence and hasn't been helped by having an offensive line which has been banged up all seasons. He is also coming across as a [grumpy teenager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNN43pCycGo), it's not looking good for him the rest of the season. I can't see the 49ers getting anything from this game and hopefully they have checked out by the time they come to play the Chargers.

The Chargers have a big one against the Broncos. With Ingram and Teo back our defense has looked a lot stronger these last few weeks. Hopefully we can stop their run and Manning has looked out of sorts last few weeks. Makes me wonder whether he has some sort of injury to his arm or shoulder. On the flipside hopefully we can get the run established and keep our offense on the field.

Bolo Tie Time!

The match up of the weekend is the Eagles against the Cowboys, it's just a shame that it is on at one thirty in the morning so I won't be able to watch it. They are always feisty affairs, the key for Dallas is to keep their offense on the field otherwise their defense will be gassed by the uptempo Eagles playing style.

Real Madrid have won their 20th game in a row, which is ridiculous. I think it shows the state of football. There are a few elite teams in each league who have the money to attract the best talent, the rest of the teams tread water hoping to win a cup. Ronaldo scored two, what he and Messi are/have been doing the last five years is otherworldly.
