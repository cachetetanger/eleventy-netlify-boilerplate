I have a memory of being taught football by my friend Khalid on the road in front of our big yellow house in Oujda. The front of the house had a low wall with a balustrade, my brothers and I used to shoot fireworks at passing cars through the balusters and duck down behind the wall. Anyway I digress, Khalid was dribbling towards me and kept telling me he was going to pass me on my right. He did it over and over and I didn't tackle him once. I must have been six at the time and I was terrible, still am. I moved to England for school and lived with my gran in Cambridge, this is where I started to play football a lot. I played every breaktime at school and with my friends after school on the green outside the front of our house. I have a vague memory of Italia 90 and Gazza crying, a lot clearer is the memory of Spurs beating Arsenal 3-0 in the 1991 FA Cup semi-final. That is when I chose to support Spurs, if only Arsenal had won, it would have saved me a lot of frustration.

At the time Cambridge United were riding high and pushing for a promotion into the First Division, which they achieved only to be relegated the following season. That summer my brother and I got to go to a week long camp run by the club. The highlight was the final afternoon when the players turned up, took pictures with us and signed memorabilia. My favourite item was a mug with a Cambridge United logo on it, I took it to university with me and has become a prized possession. I bought a dishwasher last year and when I used it to wash the mug, it came out blank. Gutting. It is now just a white mug.

Looking back at those black and white photos of me and my brother with the players, it seems a lifetime ago. This was football from another era, before the money of the Premier League came in. I still have one of these [hats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hmzfb_GHDi4#t=168) (I think those hats need to make a return for promoted teams) but I am yet to buy a [Dube.](http://www.thedube.com/) I wonder who Dion will be supporting in the FA Cup fourth round?

##### Park End

I hadn't won a game of football since I've turned 33, my last victory came in early Ocotber and it put us top of the league. Then [Birstall happened](http://thecroggy.com/butchered/) and we haven't really recovered since, we lost seven in a row and [drew our last game before Christmas, which felt like a victory as we only had ten men.](http://thecroggy.com/a-winning-draw/)

I had a lovely Christmas break where apart from the occasional wintry walk exercise was non-existent, replaced by grazing and mooching. My go to snack over the holidays was.....er food.

I ate so much.

I don't diet and don't have a problem with putting on weight even if I do over eat. I have a friend who is a glutton and he views dieting as allowing him to eat whatever he wants once the diet has finished. Think of him like Ronaldo, not Cristiano the [other one.](http://img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/00530/ron6_280x390_530749a.jpg)

Coming into the game on Saturday I was expecting it to be a hard slog, but at least everyone else would be in the same boat. Northfield Emerald were our opponents, they were level on points with us but had played a game less. There was an icy wind which blew across the pitch as opposed from behind one goal, we also had a big puddle just inside one half which we had to sweep the water out of before kick off. It became a [massive boggy patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj9KD-kjLMY#t=47) where the ball stopped dead. We took the lead in comical fashion, Dan Gabriel hit a ball long for Kyle, but it was a terrible pass, overhit by miles.

The defender ran back to retrieve it.

Their goalie came out to claim it.

Banzi our right wing chased after it.

Their players didn't communicate and the goalie seeing Banzi closing in panicked and tried to clear it but kicked it straight into the defender. The ball rolled towards the goal and Banzi had a tap in.

The equaliser came from a penalty, when their player dived to win it. It was frustrating he went down so easily and they were back in the game without warranting it. The game was being played in our half most of the time but we were able to keep them in front of us and they didn't get in behind. They were a young team and it showed, they tried to do to much with the ball and we would normally crowd them out. Our second goal was scored by Banzi, he ran onto a through ball and finished calmly passed the keeper.

I almost scored a worldy. I don't score many and this would have been the best goal I have ever scored. We had a throw on the left about 20 metres from their area, Dovey threw it down the line and a defender headed it away. It came to me about five metres in from the touchline and thirty metres out. I controlled the ball on my chest let it bounce and then volleyed it. Someone shouted 'That's going in!' The goalie was scrabbling across his goal, desperately trying to get to the ball.

The ball bounced on the goal line about a metre wide of the far post.

Gutted.

I would have hung up my boots right there and then.

Just before half-time we won a freekick which I tried to take quickly but it was intercepted. Kyle tracked back and won the ball Lee hammered it forward, Banzi chased the defender who passed it back to the keeper. The keeper instead of clearing it first time took a touch and the ball flicked up, he tried to control it on his knee but instead gave the ball to Banzi a metre out who gratefully accepted the gift.

3-1 up at half-time.

All the luck that has gone against us over the last three months finally seems to be changing. Now we had to keep it tight and make sure they didn't score. Although they had the lion's share of possession they weren't able to do much with it. They had one good chance that Craig cleared off the line, but apart from that it was long shots that didn't trouble Heath. I got cramp with less than ten minutes to go, the sticky ground and lack of exercise over Christmas caught up with me. Banzi managed to grab a fourth, the final goal of the game.

A day shy of three months since our last win, a long time no matter which way you look at it. Taking down the nets in the frigid wind didn't seem that bad and there was a lot more banter than usual. Banzi said that he had been running over Christmas because he was fed up with being unfit in games. It showed, he has only played three games for us and in the other two he couldn't last the pace. A great replacement for James, having Banzi match fit adds an attacking element which we have been missing in our midfield. He also helped out defensively, hopefully he makes it most Saturdays. We are now seventh in the table with seventeen points from thirteen games and a goal difference of zero.

##### NFL Divisional-Round

What a weekend of football, every game was great, except the Hawks win over the Panthers, it wasn't fair matching a Cam Newton led offense against that D. I thought he might not come out of it alive.

So there was the catch which wasn't a catch, the cunning (read cheating) of Belichick and perhaps the decline of the greatest QB to play the game. The thing with the Bryant catch is the refs called it right. It seems like a dumb rule but he lost control of the ball when it hit the ground. You have got to feel a little sorry for the Cowboys....actually no you don't. It's not even karma getting back at them for the terrible non-call of pass interference against the Lions because the refs made the correct call in this case.

Belichick consistently finds ways of getting it done, Boston fans love him, the rest of us can't stand him. It feels unsportsmanlike to mess around with formations, I know it is in the rules but it is stretching them. If teams did this week in week out then it wouldn't be such a big deal, but it felt underhand. John Harbaugh was livid on the sideline and got an unsportsmanlike penalty, he says his issue isn't with the Patriots but with the ['mechanincs of the officiating'](http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2014/story/_/id/12162036/baltimore-ravens-john-harbaugh-trick-plays-new-england-determine-outcome-game) and he didn't think those three plays determined the outcome of the game.

In their loss both Harbaugh and Garret have been gracious and congratulatory to the winners, not blaming the officiating for their losses, which is a credit to them.

Is this the end for Manning? If it is, it's a shame because he went out in such underwhelming fashion. Sport does not respect the past, it only respects the present. His body is not what it was, there has been much talk about his neck surgeries, maybe his body can't keep up with the rigours of a whole season. In the press conference after the game he looked like a man defeated. It was a loss in which the finger of blame pointed squarely at him. In the meantime he has a lot of thinking to do, he is due $21 million next season, I am sure he does not need the money but that must be very tempting. There will be a new head coach and possibly offensive coordinator, so that is something else he will have to take into consideration. I can't see John Fox being out of work for long.
