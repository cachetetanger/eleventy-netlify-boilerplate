At the 1962 World Cup Italy played Chile in Santiago in a group game. Two Italian journalists had written disparaging articles about Santiago leading up to the game, rousing local anger towards them and the Italian team. The first foul supposedly happened within twelve seconds of the kick-off and the first red card in the twelfth minute. By all accounts it was closer to a medieval battle than a football match. When it was shown on the BBC David Coleman introduced it as ["the most stupid, appalling, disgusting and disgraceful exhibition of football, possibly in the history of the game."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=uOtL1m1o_ok#t=13) I would have liked to see what he thought of our game against RBL Birstall, they made the Italians look like saints. The first inkling that this was going to be a brutal game was when our best player went down injured from an innocuous coming together in the box. One of their midfielders started shouting at him 'Get the fuck up, you fucking cheat.' I had to do a double take, what is going on, why has this guy lost it already? Needless to say he was an animal on the pitch along with most of his teammates. There were two horror tackles, their players flying in two footed, I still don't know how they didn't break legs. There were stamps, leaving studs in after the ball had gone, late tackles, really late tackles and even a hit to the face. The first yellow card came after we were awarded a free-kick which they disagreed with, one of their players  picked up the ball and threw it as hard as he could into James face. It was bonkers.

Where was the ref in all this? He was there bless his socks. A fresh faced boy of eighteen. Talk about being thrown to the wolves. He was intimidated. Who wouldn't be? I was, especially when I knew the ref was going to let them get away with their dirty play. Half our team wasn't really up for it, even so we managed to stay in the game and were one nil down at half-time. We told ourselves to keep it tight, don't retaliate and try to nick a goal.  A ball into our box hit Dovey's chest near his arm, Birstall players appealed, the people watching appealed and the ref bottled it.

Penalty.

That is when our heads dropped, we felt like it wasn't going to be our day. They kept on flying into tackles, swearing at us and the ref when a decision went against them. We were all kicked so many times, I came off injured five minutes from the end. One of their players who I had just tackled wellied me as hard as he could on my ankle, he was nowhere near the ball. I could barely walk, he showed no remorse and told me to fuck off. The ref didn't book him and I hobbled off, finished for the day.  Dan got in a tussle with one of their players, Dan started it by deliberately barging into the back of the player. Their player got back up and pushed Dan who fell down like a sack of potatoes and rolled about holding his face, he got up two seconds later laughing. They both got booked, although their captain was asking for a red. They ended up winning four nil. At the final whistle their captain was talking to the ref in a really condescending way 'I let you make the decision with their player and you only gave him a yellow. To be honest I am really disappointed in you, I expected you to do better. I didn't take matters into my own hands because I thought I could trust you.' I almost lost it there and then, they would have had bookings into double figures and probably ended the game with only five men if the ref had been half decent. Here he was lecturing him about how we should have had a red card. I have been angry for the last two days because of it. We complained to the league about them and it turns out the local FA have a case against them because they have done this before.

Which should make the game against them in two weeks feisty. On the plus side the league said they would provide assistants and a stronger referee.

As much as it pains me to say it, the Dallas Cowboys are looking very good. I don't think the wheels will come off after this loss, although if they lose Romo after this [sack,](http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014102700/2014/REG8/redskins@cowboys#menu=gameinfo|contentId%3A0ap3000000419045&tab=recap) it will be a big blow. Weedon looked capable, but he is too much of an unknown quantity to have going into the business end of the season. It may mean that they have to ride Murray even more. Although it won't help Murray's career, with running backs having the shortest careers in the NFL. He will want to get paid, but I doubt he will get a long term monster deal as they have very little cap space.  Dez Bryant is probably more of a priority. In the short term they will probably give Murray the franchise tag and that negates any durability issues. With his current form, who knows maybe Dallas will win that long eluded Super Bowl, but then again maybe he will go down next game.
