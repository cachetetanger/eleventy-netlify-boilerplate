One of the downsides of living in England is that the Super Bowl is on late at night. I don't mind staying up late to watch a regular season game, however with the Super Bowl I enjoy the event not only the game. A party and the Super Bowl go hand in hand. Hosting a party is hard when the game runs into the early hours of the morning. The casual fan is reticent to come especially when work starts only hours after the game ends. If the game is a blow out like Seattle's win last year bed becomes evermore enticing as the game wears on. I don't want football to be competing with sleep, especially not the Super Bowl, that is why I watch the game Monday evening after work.

By watching it on Monday the casual fan is willing to commit, also everyone has a friend who has no clue about the game and only comes for the food. Everyone who attends brings a dish, usually something American, well at least what we consider to be American. I look forward to the food almost as much as the game itself, my wife makes an amazing seven layer dip.

Trying to avoid the score is the biggest challenge of the day. I prepped my work colleagues on Friday so they knew not to say anything at work on Monday. In every office there is the person who wants to connect with you and tell you about something they know you are interested in. In this case it would be the Super Bowl. So the first thing I said to my work colleagues on Monday is 'Don't tell me the score.' I almost shouted it. I have to say they were great, not one of them said a thing, especially as a few of them are fans. Next you have to make sure no-one sends you a text with the score in it, I forgot my phone at home so no issue there. Crucially avoid any websites that might have the score. This is hard for me, especially as I spend half my time at work on the likes of ESPN and Deadspin. I haven't had as productive a day at work for months.

However no matter how hard you try there are always things out of your control. You might walk past someone in a Seahawks jersey. What does that mean? Did the Seahawks win? Are they just a massive fan and are wearing the jersey even though they lost? I was sitting at my desk and looked out the window, something I do fairly regularly and watch people walk by. What were the chances that I would see an American academic from the east coast wearing a Patriots beanie? That is the only thing I saw all day concerning the Super Bowl and because of it I was convinced the Patriots won.

Or did they?

The friend with a massive HDTV was free to host the party.

YES!

National Anthem.

Check.

What a game.

Just wow!

In the end I think injuries may have cost Seattle the game. I know everyone is talking about the interception when they should have run the ball but losing Lane and Avril were massive blows. Brady picked on Tharald Simon the rest of the game and after Avril's concussion their pass rush was unable to get as much pressure on Brady.

The Patriots did not seem as scared of the Seattle defense as the Broncos did last year. There weren't any huge hits apart from Chancellor's helmet to helmet on Edelman, they also missed a few tackles, admittedly not easy ones but it felt like they weren't quite as intimidating compared to previous games. A part of that was because Brady played incredibly well, he got rid of the ball quickly and was so accurate. His last two drives were special, going 13 for 15 with the game on the line will only cement his legacy and people can use it in their greatest of all time debate. In my mind he is in the top two along with Joe Montana.

I thought The Curse had returned. [David Tyree,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27XeNefwABw) [Mario Manningham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xdTIJb9uNA) and now [Jermaine Kearse.](http://deadspin.com/jermaine-kearses-insane-super-bowl-catch-in-extreme-sl-1683234978) What presence of mind to do that. Obviously there was luck involved but take nothing away from Kearse that was special. Unfortunately because of the outcome of the game there weren't any KEARSED headlines.

How did Hightower tackle Lynch. The touchdown seemed like a sure thing.

To get off his block and throw out an arm to trip up Lynch was the play of the game after the Kearse catch, closely followed by Butler's interception.

Why did they not run it? I suppose they wanted four goes at getting into the end zone and by choosing a pass, if it was incomplete the clock would have stopped. It was also a ballsy call by Belichick, everyone was expecting him to call a time out but he didn't. In doing so put all the pressure on Carroll and baiting him into a mistake. After the game Butler said he knew what was coming, they had practiced this before the game. Bill Simmons points out he even warns Browner to the pass.

What great coaching and execution by the Patriots.....again.

What a devastating way to lose. Sherman's face said it all. I am sure they will be competitive and get over this loss.

Now I have to wait until September 10th for the next meaningful game of football. What am I going to do with my time?
