I haven't been running for awhile and I felt like a right chuffer when I started up again. Now I have been doing it pretty consistently for 6 weeks I feel close to my old self. At the moment I am trying to crack a 20 minute 5k, I have managed to get it down to 20.49. I reckon if I can do a bit of training, I should break it within two weeks.

Since I've made that prediction I haven't run once as I have been busy with work and my boys seem to think it's a good idea to wake up at the [crack of dawn.](https://youtu.be/Woqpmp2DjaY?t=12) Another excuse, is I cycle to work, 25 miles round trip, two days a week. The other day at work I had been digging a trench and when I got home I was wasted. After dinner I hurt everywhere and couldn't stand up straight, hunched over I hobbled upstairs to the shower. Also the weather, which had warmed up since the Beast from the East had left its trail of destruction all over the country, has turned cold again.

In three attempts I have knocked over a minute off my time and have got down to 20:20. On my third crack at it, I was overtaken with less than half a mile to go by someone who beat me last time by 10 seconds, I tried to stay with him but couldn't keep up.

I've also started going back to counselling. My counsellor laughs at me as I never feel sad. In fact I don't feel a lot of emotion. Well except for irritation, frustration, anger and annoyance, nearly always passively directed towards my long-suffering wife. My kids have been starting to bear the brunt of it as well, they have a precocious talent for pushing my buttons. Joking aside it has been a tough season for me and my family, with Caitlyn carrying a lot of the burden.

I finally broke 20 minutes on my fourth attempt. I don't have a watch when I run so I'm not sure how fast I'm going, I knew I was going pretty quick at the start and hoped I still had something left at the end. On the third and final lap I passed a runner who had been about 15 metres in front of me the whole way. As I passed him he asked me what pace I was on, "I'm aiming for sub 20," I said over my shoulder. The route sloped down for 70 metres before a short climb. The climb isn't steep but as it is towards the end of the lap and it's the third time up it, it can feel longer and steeper than it is. I didn't hold back and once at the top, with my lungs burning I pushed on.

Only two hundred metres to the finish.

I crossed the line gasping for breath.

I doubled over with hands on my knees trying to recover. I came thirteenth, when I got home and checked the results a few hours later, it showed I did it in 19:43. I am well chuffed with that. Next target sub 19. I think that will take a little longer for me to achieve and I'll have to start doing the mundane boring miles, alone.
