I had one of those games where just about everything went well for me. I took players on and beat them, I created chances and was involved in a lot of good our team did. I had energy and was able to get up and down the pitch in the first half, in the second half I went up front so I only had to stay up the field. It is a lot less tiring playing up front and I could switch off a bit when we didn't have the ball. I also scored, which brings me up to three for the season. Unbelievable.

To be fair they were a poor, they are bottom of Division Two and lost their previous game eleven nil. They had three subs at the start of the game but two of them walked off when they went behind. There have been similar times at Park End this season, when we were struggling for a couple of months after our butchering by Birstall, team morale was low especially as we kept losing.

As we had finished most of our games before other teams the League decided to put on a cup competition for teams in a similar boat. There are ten teams divided into two groups, we lost our first game when I was in the States, it was to Kibworth who hadn't won a game all season. This was our second game of the cup, the wind was again coming from behind one goal and fortunately we got to play against it first half.

Our first twenty minutes were poor, we didn't get the ball down and our passes were off and we didn't get into a rhythm. Our frustration was starting to mount, especially when simple balls were played poorly and it only got worse when they scored. I thought we had won a freekick just inside their half, so I went up to their box waiting for the ball to be played in. I turned around to see Dovey taking a throw-in to Dave who gave the ball away and their speedy striker did everyone for pace and scored past Heath on the second time of asking. It was a great individual goal but a very frustrating one to concede as it was from silly errors. I don't know how I thought it was a freekick, I was miles out of position when Dovey took the throw-in leaving Dave with no easy option.

After this we began to take hold of the game, I picked up the ball in midfield and took it past my man, which surprised me as it happened so easily and then I took it past a couple of defenders and was in the box, I went to cross and the ball came off my toe and went out for a goal kick. It was a really poor attempt at a cross but at least everything up to that point had gone well. We soon started to assert ourselves and physically we were a lot stronger and they shied away from challenges. We bundled the ball into the goal but it was disallowed because the ref said the keeper had two hands on the ball.

I received a throw-in which was under thrown and should have been cut out by their left back, who looked like a young Javier Zanetti when I told one of their players that he replied 'Shame he can't play like him.' Anyway back to the throw-in, he missed the ball so I ran onto it and into the box set up the central defender and beat him to the bye line and crossed it. The keeper expected me to pull it back, which I tried to do but it was on my right foot and it would have gone along the goal line but the keeper fumbled the ball back to me. Standing on the byline just outside the six yards box I hit the ball instinctively back towards the goal and imagine my surprise as the ball went in despite the acute angle.

The first half ended one all and we would have the wind with us for the second half, I managed to convince Lee to put me upfront and bring Wes into centre midfield. Our second goal came from a quick throw in, I threw it to Wes who played it back to me and I crossed it into their area, it wasn't a particular good cross and the keeper came out for it but only managed to flap it away to the edge of the box. Grundy was waiting for it and used perfect technique, which is something not often said about anyone in our team let alone Grundy who volleyed it back into an open goal.

I had a chance to score my fourth goal of the season which would have given me one more than Dave. Kyle won a penalty after a clumsy challenge, Dave should have taken the penalty but I insisted that Kyle take it because he had been fouled. I was also trying to get his confidence up as he hasn't scored for awhile. Craig was telling Dave he should take it and Kyle didn't really want to take it, but I insisted that he did. The penalty was saved, if his confidence wasn't at rock bottom before it definitely was now. I followed up the penalty which the keeper saved with his legs and it came back to me, I had the whole goal to aim at, one problem was the ball was on my right foot, I tried hard to keep the volley down but instead I connected so well that the ball cleared the bar(just) but went for miles. I turned in disbelief with my [hands on my head,](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/sep/04/thisweekssciencequestions1) everyone else was still on the edge of the box, no-one else had followed up the penalty I could have walked the ball in. Dave was not impressed in the slightest. We ended up winning three one which I was very relieved at.

I couldn't play last weekend as it was my son's birthday, we beat Broughton Astley four one, Kibworth have two wins but we have a better goal difference, so it comes down to their final game against North Kilworth. I have played both teams so I don't have high hopes for us getting to the semi-final as I can't see North Kilworth beating them.

##### Real Football

Are Leicester going to escape? They have got the easiest run in of all the teams at the bottom. It could come down to the last game, QPR away, I hope so it would make for an epic final day. It seems that Spurs have given up the ghost for the season, they have five games left to prove me wrong but two of their last three outings against Burnley and Villa have been insipid at best.

What a shame that Klopp is leaving Dortmund. It has been a rough year and for the last few seasons their top talent has moved onto bigger clubs. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be for Klopp to have those players leave, it reminds me a bit of Arsenal's last decade. I am used to it as a Spurs fan, but we are never genuine challengers for anything so I don't begrudge the players moving on. Whereas for Dortmund it is different, up until last season they were a scary proposition for any of Europe's elite clubs and were genuine contenders domestically and in Europe.

##### Lame joke of the week

I would like Juan Mata Paneer, a pilau rice and one garlic naan.

##### Spring

I love this time of year. The sun gets high enough in the sky to bring it's warmth. My back garden is south facing and it is gorgeous this time of year. The cherry tree is just starting to blossom and asparagus spears are starting to show, along with the peas that I planted last weekend. The raspberry and gooseberry plants are growing bigger, it never ceases to amaze me how quickly they grow, a couple of weeks ago they were not even showing out of the ground.

I am also converting my loft, hopefully it will be done in the weeks to come and then I can focus on decking and then pizza oven.
