I have become a big fan of cycling recently and not just an armchair fan, although I haven't reached [this level](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/) yet. I can comfortably ride thirty miles and wanting a challenge I entered the [Rutland Epique Sportive](http://www.itpevents.co.uk/event/the-rutland-border-epique), I chose the 54 mile option as I wanted to finish it, with the 74 and 111 mile options I would have been picked up by the broom wagon. The morning of the sportive I was a bundle of nervous energy and forced myself to eat a big breakfast of porridge and weetabix. I had convinced my dad, uncle, cousin and my mate Tim to join me.

We drove the twenty minutes to Cafe Ventoux and found the car park was already full and they were struggling to find places to put the late comers. We were ushered to a space behind a couple of large sheds, as I got out of the car a marshall was talking animatedly into a walkie talkie 'Don't let anyone park on the grass. Repeat! Don't let anyone park on the grass.' We headed to the registration tent where we were given our number, timing chip and a couple of energy gels.

Once we had got ourselves ready we headed to the start line, we stood out amongst the crowd of lycra. My dad always gets cold on a bike so wears trackie bottoms, a pretty thick jacket and skiing gloves. I had a spare pair of cycling gloves which made him look only slightly less ridiculous. He also has magnetic goggles that go over his glasses to protect from glare.

Elliot's bike belonged to my lodger and the gears didn't work properly and it weighed a ton, that's what you get when you ride a racer from the 80s. Martyn didn't have a bike as he lives in New Zealand, he was looking in his mum's garage and came across a girl's racer with five gears. He put on new tires, oiled the chain and swapped over the break blocks as the front ones had less wear on them. The start was up a steep hill which was a test straight away for Elliot and Martyn. It soon became apparent that Elliot's bike had a rattle, the chain was rubbing against something on the back wheel, we were never able to pinpoint exactly what it was so he rode the whole thing with a jangle.

Tim began to bonk early on as he hadn't eaten breakfast and was lagging behind by the time we got to the feed station at 29 miles. We all duly stuffed our faces and I put three jaffa cakes into the back pocket of my cycling shirt. It turned out to be a terrible idea as the chocolate melted and they fell apart when I tried to take them out and was left with a crumbly mess all over my hands. The [course](http://www.gpsies.com/map.do?fileId=bvzviqbncysanjjw) would be described as rolling but the last half of it had quite a few climbs. I struggled on my 'nice' bike with clip in pedals, I don't know how Elliot and Martyn managed it.

Towards the end I was overtaken on a hill by a guy who looked the part, I felt ok as I hadn't pushed myself too hard as I was staying with Elliot. I foolishly thought to myself 'I'm going to beat him to the top of the hill.' I pedalled hard and got on his wheel and felt fine after the effort and with the speed we were doing. There was another rider thirty metres up the road, we caught him and as we did I launched my attack at what I guessed was just below the brow of the hill. I upped my cadence and went past both cyclists. As I neared the top of the hill, I realised it wasn't the top and the road continued to climb round a corner about 100 metres further on. I was determined to not let the guy catch me so kept up my pedalling thinking the top of the hill must be just after the corner. I rounded the corner and the road continued to climb, sweat began to drip off my face onto the top tube, big salty drops. I just kept on pedalling, will this hill ever end, my legs were burning from the effort and my breathing was coming in loud gasps. I finally made it to the top and there was a right turn onto a slight descent, I looked round for the first time and could see 30 metres down the road and there was no-one in sight. I knew I had about 7 or 8 miles to the finish and so I decided to go for it, see if I could beat this guy. Head down clunk through the gears and pedal hard, the next few miles were downhill and I was able to recover. I came to another hill and put my all into it and at the top was spent, there were a couple of cyclists ahead of me on the climb and I used them as a marker. I overtook the first as the climb ended and passed the other not long after. This was when I saw my first sign for Cafe Ventoux, I knew it must only be a couple of miles. I hadn't seen any road signs with mileage on for Tugby, but the Ventoux sign spurred me on.

The road began to climb again and I started to feel sick and dizzy and a moment later the cyclist passed me up the hill, I cracked and wanted to stop. All I could hear was my heart pounding in my head and I thought I was going to faint, I cursed my bike and continued to pedal with my head down. The hill felt like it would never end and when I looked up again the cyclist had already disappeared. I railed at my hubris, the nauseating feeling muddled my mind and I almost fell off my bike.

Am I actually moving?

The hill finally ended and I had a downhill section where I began to feel like a person again, a left turn and a road sign saying Tugby 1Â½ miles. There was a long straight ahead of me, slightly uphill and the cyclist disappeared round a corner quarter mile ahead of me. I wanted to get off and walk. The rest of the ride was a bit hazy and when I got back to the car and off my bike I had a vacant look and moved about unsteadily for a minute before sitting down. Elliot finished 10 minutes after me and Tim turned up a few minutes later, Martyn and my dad appeared another 10 minutes after him. I felt sick and my legs were sore, but now it was time to head over to the food tent and replenish our depleted bodies. The food was served in the tent we had registered in and I expected it to be excellent because the tagline for the sportive was 'the two major concerns of the cyclist; riding and eating.'

Penne pasta.

I can't stand penne pasta. Especially when it is served with a damp squib of an excuse for sauce. It was tasteless and I was disappointed as I was looking forward to it, I didn't finish it which tells you how bad it was.

My first time fishing was three years ago, Caitlyn and her dad took me to [Granite lake](http://www.yosemitehikes.com/tioga-road/gaylor-lakes/gaylor-lakes.htm) in Tuolumne Meadows. After a short but very steep hike carrying my 3 month old baby we came to an alpine meadow with Granite and Gaylor lakes stretched out before us, we hiked to the edge of Granite lake and took out our fishing poles. I caught a fish on my second cast, I felt such a sense of achievement and the rugged beauty of my surroundings added to the moment. I have been wanting to go fishing again ever since but have never had the chance until last week. A friend who fishes quite a bit took me to the canal by South Wigston. We found a spot on the tow path, there was a hedge behind us and the sound of a cow munching on grass came from the other side of it. The sky was covered in cumulus clouds, the sun breaking through periodically warming me and changing the tone of the water.

Bob set me up and left me to it. There was a moorhen in the reeds on the far bank, the reflection of the sky and trees in the glassy water, this image would become amorphous when wind whipped up waves only to return again when it became still. Waiting for a bite, the wind rustling the reeds, a stirring on the far bank, it's the moorhen searching for food to feed its young.

'A bird's nest.' My fledgling hobby had become a snarl of fishing line which worsened when my clumsy untrained fingers tried to untangle it, I hailed Bob from his peaceful perch lest I made it worse. His expert fingers unpicked my weave with ease and he was about to return to his seat when he noticed my float was missing. Bob thought it was snagged on a branch, I wound in the line and to my surprise and Bob's amazement there was a fish on the end of it. I ended catching 10 fish over the next 4 hours. I haven't had as relaxing an afternoon in a longtime, tranquillity, sitting without any distraction, just me my mind and the wind.
