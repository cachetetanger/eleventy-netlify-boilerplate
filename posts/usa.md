Whenever I go on holiday to America I always ask myself why I live in Leicester. The weather in California was warm and it took me back to my childhood growing up in Morocco. What Seattle lacked in warmth it made up for in beauty, [Mount Rainier](http://www.sandychin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Seattle.jpg) looms large over the city and the snowcapped Olympics frame it to the west. The inordinate amount of trees and water add to the proximity of nature and the air feels fresher, cleaner.

Another reason I enjoy Seattle is because hipster culture is obsessed with food and so there are a [plethora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mTUmczVdik) of great restaurants. My brother took me to [Portage Bay](http://www.portagebaycafe.com/) for breakfast, so good, so so good. There is something so immense and exciting about American breakfasts that English breakfasts lack. I am not sure if it is the choice or the mix of sweet and savoury, syrup on bacon is about as close to perfection as food gets, it is so completely different to a Full English.

I played a game of five aside football with my brother in-law, the standard of which was pretty good and it surprised me. I expected the standard to be poor and I felt ashamed of my arrogance. I fell into the trap of thinking because I am from a prestigious (don't laugh) footballing nation that we are better than Americans.

Quick question, who got further at the last World Cup?

They do use different terminology like 'ball in' whenever the ball comes back in play. It is easy to focus on those differences and think they are footballing Luddites, when it is only unimportant differences and quite frankly they seem to be doing fine following their way, perhaps it's time we took note of how they do things.

Seattle is a footballing success story, the Sounders average attendance last season was over forty three thousand which would put them sixth in the [Premier League.](http://www.soccerstats.com/attendance.asp?league=england) The Pacific Northwest has three big teams less than six hours apart which has made for a growing regional rivalry.

Back in California the weather was warm, really warm and I lounged outside whilst my son played in shorts and t-shirt, contrast that with the day before he left England wrapped up in a coat and wearing wellies. I was thinking to myself I could get used to this heat, he was enjoying being in the garden and I was only to happy to stay outside and watch him play.

The highlight of the trip for me was driving. I love driving and driving in America is my favourite. The seemingly endless miles of road taking you wherever you want to go, I enjoy pouring over maps and imagining a road trip, my dream road trip would be to go to all the towns that are named after European capital cities. I hired a car and drove up from Orange County to the Bay Area to visit family. Interstate 210 wends along the San Gabriel Mountains, it is a beautiful drive and I kept passing signs of places I had heard of; Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena and Monrovia(no not that Monrovia). The 210 merges with I5 at the foot of Tejon Pass and slowly climbs over the mountains before a very steep and rather hairy descent to the San Joaquin Valley. The Central Valley produces billions of dollars worth of agriculture making it very important to California's economy. A few people I talked to mentioned the drought and thought the water saving measures implemented on households were unfair as 80% of California's water is used in agriculture. There were countless [signs](http://d3vs4613l1445x.cloudfront.net/archive/x468147802/WaterSigns1-jb-JPG/g30e2200000000000006959fb503da1dded0ce076f056b81708fbea8162.jpg) by the side of the highway, either way you look at it California has a massive water problem which will need some massive investment to solve.

Almond groves line either side of the route for miles and miles most trees had a smattering of blossom left on them the rest having fallen to the ground, leaving a soft cushion round the boughs. There were also beehives every few hundred meters, the amount of hives and bees is mind boggling. The bees and hives traverse the country pollinating other crops, apples, melons and cranberries to mention a few and are essential to agriculture in the US. However bee populations are falling partly because of modern farming techniques and increased use of pesticides. This is another issue that not only California but the rest of the US will have to wrestle with.

Most people I have talked to do not enjoy driving the stretch of the 5 through the Central Valley because it is only two lanes and there are so many slower vehicles that you generally get stuck behind a line of cars waiting to overtake them. At first I wanted to overtake every car in front of me, after awhile I got frustrated so I slowed down and enjoyed the rest of the drive. I have a game I play when I go to the US, I try to see a number plate from each state, so the drive was a great opportunity for me to cross some off the list, by the end of the holiday I had 31, although I was hoping for a few more. It did mean that I would chase cars trying to read their number plate, it only nearly ended in disaster once.

Del Valle Regional Park is stunning, a deep valley with a narrow lake and beautiful old oak trees. The hillsides were green and it reminded me a bit of being in the peak district, I am used to Californian hillsides being a lot browner, but this time of the year they still were covered in grass. A gem of a place that I definitely will be going back to if I am in the area.

The Bay Area feels very different from Orange County, it was a lot greener and cooler for a start and there were so many cyclists. We were in Livermore and downtown was packed with families walking around and the sound of children playing mixed with music from restaurants and bars. It reminded me of a cross between England and Morocco, the City is doing a great job at bringing the community together.

The drive back to Orange County is what I had been looking forward to most as we were taking a different route back along Highway 1. It is a beautiful road that follows the Pacific Coast with incredible views and deserted beaches. Unfortunately we didn't have any good views as it was foggy, thick fog, which meant a lot of the time we could barely make out the sea. I had been wanting to stop at Bixby Bridge but it was so foggy I only realised I had missed the turn out when I was halfway across the bridge. At least it gives me an excuse to do the drive another time when hopefully the skies will be clearer. Choosing to go down the 1 added six hours to our journey time which I loved but my wife and two year old wanted out after only a couple of hours. The shit they have to put up with.

Some other highlights and random thoughts in no particular order. In-N-Out Burger, a must for anyone who goes to California, the double double is delicious and I love their burger sauce.

Cheap Mexican food, readily available and again delicious. More houses need solar panels, seriously why doesn't everyone have them. Having said that there are lots more compared to when I first started coming out seven years ago. The Ducks had better win the Stanley Cup so I can say I watched the winning team. Food seems really expensive at grocery stores and we need these in England.

The first thing I did when I got home was make Marmite on toast, I had also left my car unlocked for three weeks.
