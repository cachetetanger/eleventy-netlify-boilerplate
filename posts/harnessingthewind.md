When I was seventeen I played a game of rugby against Dean Close, they were big rivals who we had never beaten during our time at school. The first half we played excellently and pinned them down in their own half and we went into the half-time with a slender lead. We all got ahead of ourselves and were thinking 'This might be the year when we finally beat them.' What I didn't realise was how important a factor the wind had been in keeping them in their half. It only became apparent when I took a penalty in our twenty two. I kicked for touch, the ball left my foot and immediately I realised it was not going to make more than five metres. The only time we got out of our twenty two in the second hald was for kick-offs. We ended up losing by over twenty points.

I knew the wind was going to be a factor in the game on Saturday but unfortunately I lost the toss and we played with the wind at our backs in the first half. The wind wasn't as strong as [this](http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2012/feb/29/goalkeeper-scores-wind-assisted-own-goal-video) but it ended up being the deciding factor. We went into half-time three two up, having let in two really sloppy goals. What killed us along with the wind was their quick striker and our lack of pace at the back. He scored eight goals, yes EIGHT goals and they won ten three. Heath was shocking, I don't think he made a save and never looked like getting anywhere close to keeping a shot out. To be fair, he didn't have much help from the defence or the rest of us for that matter. Instead of playing football we resorted to trying to hit it long and could not get out of our half. It was a disheartening performance. Next time I will tell the team we need to go into half-time with at least an eight goal lead.

I had planned a party at mine after the game. I am not sure if it was the result, but it was the lamest party. The Mexican food my wife and I had prepared was looked upon with suspicion, there was no atmosphere. In a word it sucked, along with the Chargers.

At least we have the Birstall Butchers to look forward to this weekend.
