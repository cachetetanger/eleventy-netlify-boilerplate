There was an Austrian footballer called Hans Krankl, arguably the best footballer Austria has ever produced. However in England he is remembered mainly because his name is used in cockney rhyming slang for ankle. You may be wondering why I chose to title this blog after him? Well I have injured my Krankl and it looks like my season is over unless I have an incredibly speedy recovery. I managed to tear my medial ankle ligament rather innocuously. I jumped for a ball and when I landed I heard a crunch and I collapsed in a heap. A shooting pain in my ankle. Game over. My parents have never seen me play football and were in town, so they planned to come along. Unfortunately by the time they arrived I had already been carried off. Who knows now if they will ever see me play.

As my season is most likely over I will start to blog about other topics.
