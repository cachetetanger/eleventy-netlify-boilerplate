In my mind's eye my front wheel disappeared into a large pothole. I'm on my knees looking down at the road, blood streaming onto my trousers and the road making big dark red blotches. My head is hurting, more than hurting, someone is telling me I should move off the road. I crawl to a traffic light and grab it. How can I make this pain stop, I need to call Caitlyn, what is happening to me. My phone is in my pocket, stand up, pull yourself up then using the traffic light, I'm in a low crouch. This must have been what it was like in the trenches when a shell exploded near you. I think I am crying out in anguish and pain, I need to call Caitlyn, I can't get my hand to reach inside my pocket. She won't be able to go to counselling tonight. A man and paramedic are talking near me, they are calm. Agony, it needs to stop, what if it doesn't stop? Call Caitlyn. Call Caitlyn. Standing up now, trying to reach into my pocket, my hand won't go in my pocket. Is there a hole in my head? Agony. Distress. Torment. Laceration. Cruciation. The man is saying he was a few bike lengths back and went to clear some condensation from his glasses and next thing he knew I was on the floor. Paramedic telling me I've taken a knock to the head, to sit down. Halting steps towards building to slump against. No sit in the ambulance it is warm. An ambulance is parked beside me, the front door is opened and painfully I climb into the front seat. The amygdala is calling the shots, no more agony, just pain and a rising ache in my left wrist.

Fumbling fingers reach my phone and the man who stopped asks who I need to call. Unlock phone and hand it over. Caitlyn Binti? I nod. He calls Caitlyn for me. I sit in the cab and see him pacing up and down the pavement, occasionally I catch his muffled voice through the closed door. Let's have a look at you. I turn to the ambulance driver who takes a close look at my face. What happened? Not sure. Were you hit by a car? No, that was a week ago. You're not having much luck are you. No. Were you wearing a helmet? No. Should have been wearing a helmet. Did you blackout? No. I'll try and clean this out for you, we have a patient in the back, you can sit here and wait for the other ambulance to arrive and take you to the hospital. Wincing from the pain as he dabs around my right eye with some sort of cotton pad. He calls through the hatch to the paramedic in the back. Look at the mess he's made of his face, turnaround. I turn to see a grinning face sticking through the hatch. Ooh, were you wearing a helmet? No. You should always wear a helmet.

I talked to your wife she is sending someone to pick up your bike, I'll wait here until they turn up and she'll meet you at the hospital. Thank you. I take a selfie.

The ambulance moves to a quiet side street. What have I done? How did it happen? My wrist is what's hurting most not my face. I notice the lights from my ambulance. I'll lock my bike(infernal thing) up and pick it up tomorrow, thank you so much for all your help. I would expect someone to do it for me, wear a helmet next time you get on a bike.

Thank yous to the first paramedics as the second lot usher me onto the new ambulance. The door is open. I hear the man outside telling a paramedic his front fork broke.

I haven't been on a bike since.
