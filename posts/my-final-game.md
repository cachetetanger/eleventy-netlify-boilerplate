When I first started to play for Park End I would drink so much water the morning of a game that I would be peeing right up until kick-off. Often I would take a pee when we first got out onto the pitch and then when the ref would blow his whistle for the captains I would run to a hedge and pee again. Recently the ref the blew the whistle for the captains just as I started to pee, [I couldn't stop](https://youtu.be/io30s7-5VaQ?t=8) and had to leave the ref and the opposition captain waiting, neither particularly wanted to shake my hand when I made it to the centre circle.

I am going to miss the people and the banter, Kyle had us in stitches so often and he could spin a yarn. He once brought along Jaegermeister and Jack Daniels and offered Jaeger bombs to everyone after the game, one of our players got wasted and never turned up again. There was also the time that he didn't know how far five metres was.

Honestly.

When Dovey was telling to be within five metres of his strike partner, he was panicking because he had no clue how far he was meant to stand from him. When he told me I couldn't stop laughing. There was German Dave who had a man crush on me and always looked out for me on the pitch, he was great central midfielder to play with. His size and aggression made it a lot easier for me to play my own game, he gave me a hug before every game. We were both so left footed that we didn't know what to do when the ball came to our right feet. Tony who must have been some player in his day, but now that he was in his forties and a little more podgy he often ended up getting himself into trouble at the back. He loved to play the ball from defence and would often end up losing it which invariably led to a goal, which in turn led to a load of abuse from Heath and Craig. I admired his willingness to play football, it was just a shame that he had such misplaced confidence in his and our abilities. Craig, the co-manager who played either right back or striker. He had this annoying habit when he played right back of always smashing the ball long even when there was a simple pass on. His playing style was the polar opposite to Tony's. Craig left it on the pitch every game and always managed to score at least one cracker a season. Heath, the other co-manager and club secretary who was determined to break the club's appearance record. I'm not sure if he'll get there as it sounds like this is going to be the club's last season, which is a shame as it has been around since 1974. Anyway back to Heath, you always felt that he had at least one howler in him a game. To be fair to him it wasn't always his fault as he didn't have much help from the rest of us. My lasting impression of him will be of him shouting 'Away! Away!' as he stayed on his line when he should've come out to claim the ball. His staunch refusal to leave the safety of his six yard box was pure stubbornness and the more we shouted at him to do so the more resolute he became. On the rare occasion he did leave those familiar surrounding there was normally so much hesitation that it would have been better off if he hadn't bothered. Having said that he has pulled off some absolutely incredible saves which gave us confidence in him as a team, this was normally shattered moments later when he'd let in a [howler.](https://youtu.be/CPtes2oSiNo?t=233)

So tomorrow will be my last game, we are playing Kibworth and then I'll head to Morocco on Tuesday for a holiday and be able to wear my slippers without being persecuted. It hasn't sunk in that I'll never play men's football again. I am sure I will feel some sadness after the game, I'll miss the friends I've made and having to pee in hedges.
