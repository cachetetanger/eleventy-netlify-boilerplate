Since the half marathon in October my left achilles has been pretty sore. So instead of running I have decided to get cycling again. I haven't been on any long rides since September as it's been getting dark earlier. On my lunchbreak yesterday I went on a [ride](http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/929032279) down London Road towards Oadby. There are a few hills to get up although it ended up being quite a stop start ride as there are eight sets of traffic lights after the Race Course Roundabout. I don't normally mind cycling in traffic but there were a number of lorries which got quite close, nothing like a mouthful of warm diesel exhaust, also a coach squeezed me onto the pavement, which wasn't hairy just irritating.

In between the hills I did a few reps of twenty second bursts of flat out followed by a ten second break before going for twenty seconds again, it killed me. I was gasping by the end of my fourth rep. I will continue to cycle on my lunch it gives me energy and will get me relatively fit for the [trail run](http://bigbaztrailraces.com/16/WTRS-1entryINFO.html) I am doing in California in January. I might try and do a couple of runs around Bradgate Park to get used to running up hills.

I hate hills.

Tonight I am going to cook a joint of pork for our Thanksgiving Celebration tomorrow. I am so excited for it. One of the many benefits of marrying an American is being able to celebrate this holiday with family and friends.
