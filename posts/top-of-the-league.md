This was our chance to go top of the league, we were playing bottom of the table Kibworth. In the changing room before kickoff the atmosphere was tense, where a joke would normally have got a raucous response, instead there was nervous laughter. Watching them warm up, they had a lot of unfamiliar faces from when we played them three weeks ago. We thought that they might have brought in a load of ringers. The nervousness and thinking they were full of ringers culminated in a sloppy start, we stood off them, giving them too much time on the ball and we weren't tracking runners. We didn't keep the ball and kept on going long instead of passing short. Our frustrations mounted and we were on each others backs, when they took the lead I thought a [Bowyer Dyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFLeTm46CqQ) moment was on the cards.Â  It shouldn't have been like this, it was meant to be a stroll in the park. When Jimmy got in the way of a free header of Dovey's from six yards out, the ref had to tell Dave to stop swearing at his own teammates as children were watching. I was thinking that we were going to beat ourselves.

Settle down. Win some headers and fifty fifties.

I did a lovely bit of skill, a Maradona turn which had me running at their left back. Although I made myself look very average by over hitting the pass to the overlapping winger.

Goal Kick.

Maybe this wasn't going to be our day after all.

In The Two Towers at the battle of Helm's Deep, there is a moment when Theoden realises that all is lost and he decides on one last cavalry charge to die valiantly. At that moment when things were at their most grim Gandalf appears on Shadowfax and changes the course of the battle. My role in the match, and I don't say this lightly was similar to Gandalf's. I decided to hound their key player who nearly all their ball went through. I didn't give him a moments respite, I tackled him a few times and his touch went when he realised he had no time or space. I scored to level it. A freekick was whipped in, their marking was atrocious and I flicked on the ball and it went in off the far post, past the flailing arms of the keeper. We got a second soon after, their right back tried to pass the ball to their centre back but gave it straight to our striker who took a touch and from twenty yards smashed it past the keeper. They fell apart, like the Uruk Hai when they realised who they were up against. There was a tangible change in their attitude, panic set in and they resigned themselves to losing. It was four one by halftime and we walked out easy six one winners by the final whistle.

Top of the league.

Not many people saw that happening before the season started, myself included.

Having not watched the NFL from a young age means that there is so much that I don't know. Everybody else knows these things and when I find out about them it feels great to now be a part of the 'in crowd'. I just found out that Bill Belichick resigned as head coach of the Jets at his press conference to be announced as head coach of the Jets. He resigned in order to get the Patriots job. You all knew that already and now I do too.

The Chargers good start to the season, may well be just that, a good start. Out of their remaining ten games I would say seven are very tricky and I could see us ending the season 8-8 and missing out on the playoffs. What is on our side is finding a running back who brings much needed balance to our offense. Brandon Oliver could turn out to be the find of the season, it is incredible to see him bulldoze over people twice his size. I bet Donald Brown feels relieved, averaging 2.1 yards a carry he was getting pummelled. The injury saved him from more humiliation and punishment.
