It was strange to be leaving Morocco as we had grown accustomed to life there. I have enjoyed meeting Moroccans and speaking Arabic, although for Caitlyn it has been a lot tougher. She is pregnant and had acute morning sickness which only started to ease up in our last two weeks there. Asher tentatively began speaking a few words of Arabic and relished being able to go to the beach so often. Beets connected with Zohora, our maid and would call her name when she arrived in the morning. Both boys would get very excited as she normally brought [rghaif](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=rghaif&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD-NPy64XWAhXiLMAKHQsoAMQQ_AUICigB&biw=1147&bih=615) or [sfinj](https://www.google.co.uk/search?biw=1147&bih=615&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=sfinj+morocco&oq=sfinj+morocco&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i13i30k1.23421.24971.0.25282.5.5.0.0.0.0.81.343.5.5.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.3.218...0i7i30k1j0i13k1.YDyHg2WjP6A) with her. I already miss the food, meals on the balcony and we all miss our trips to the cafe in the mornings for our coffee, mint tea, freshly squeezed orange juice and pastries.

Our last week there consisted of packing in nearly all our spare time, working out which things to take back and which to leave. The night before we left I put the roof box back on the car ready to load up in the morning. I woke early started packing the car and struggled to fit the two suitcases in the boot, I couldn't get it to close. The suitcases were the first thing I tried to pack, I was thinking to myself that if I carried on at this rate we'd miss our ferry. It took me about five minutes of trying different combinations of packing them and one mighty shove on the boot before I was done with them. There was no plan to open the boot until we made it back to England, so now it was time put the back box on the towbar. As the car was loaded up the suspension got lower and lower, after I'd finished the back wheels were pretty close to touching the top of the wheel arches. We said our goodbyes to the workers who we'd got to know over the last two months as they built the wall. Zohora had come bearing gifts for Granjan, Moroccan biscuits which I had to stuff under my seat. There was literally no space left, I had my backpack underneath my legs. It was with sadness that we left the Cachette, it had been our home for the past three months.

Caitlyn and I sat in silence as we drove to the port, taking in as much as we could of Morocco. Fields starting to turn from green to brown, the Mercedes taxis, the red and white curbs, the chaotic order of life we'd grown accustomed to was passing before our eyes. At the port, passport control and customs check were perfunctory and swift, there was an orderly queue to get onto the ferry which didn't disintegrate into a mass of cars when the time came to let us on. The last remnants of chaos were the Moroccans from Europe disembarking the ferry for their obligatory summer sojourn in their native land. A lot of the cars were overloaded and the tops of them had tarpaulins covering the encumbrances they were bringing in with them.

The customs officials were lining up for a bumper day of bribes, which also no doubt brings with it undue stress. Having said that boarding the ferry was extremely efficient, I was the expecting chaos of border crossing like at Melilla.

It was a clear day, Spain and Gibraltar were hazy mirages in the distance, once we got moving it was too chilly go on deck so we sat inside and ate our lunch. Asher had some birthday money left over and bought himself a set of Star Wars lego which he was over the moon about, it kept him entertained all the way back to England. In Algeciras harbour, Gibraltar stood menacingly over us like an ever watchful sentinel and we also spotted a couple of dolphins whimsically playing about the ferry. Spanish customs was a tumultuous disorganised scrum, if you left an inch a car would try to sneak in and take your place in the queue. Once we made it out we stopped in Aldi and bought wine, a dried sausage and cheese as we felt starved of them for the last three months.

We drove about an hour and a half to our campsite in Torremolinos and we were taken back by how insipid it was. The pitches looked like concrete but were in actual fact finely packed gravel, which was barely any better. Our pitch was next to large boundary wall and the flats on the otherside of it looked straight down onto us. Setting up the tent I began to sweat immediately and Caitlyn was struggling with the heat. It was a relief to have finally set up the tent and an even bigger relief packing it up in the morning and getting out of there.

The drive to our next campsite took us over the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The motorway carved its way up scrubby hillsides and over dry narrow ravines. It was reminiscent of the 57 just north of Brea. Towards the end of a long incline the warning light on the dashboard lit up and made a beeping sound.

OVERHEATING

CRAP

I made it to the top of the climb and coasted down the otherside, the light and beeping soon stopped. It made for an anxious drive the rest of the day, anytime we came to a hill I said a silent prayer hoping the car would make it to the top. If I saw mountains on the horizon, anxiety would rise up until the road turned away. My nerves weren't helped by the heat either, the thermometer in the car showed the temperature at a whopping 39.5 C.

At five we arrived at our campsite and we all got out of the car much relieved to be able to stretch our legs and enjoy the breeze. The temperature was still sweltering and putting up the tent was arduous with many wipes of the forehead, sweat dripping off the end of my nose. Caitlyn and I were both fed up with putting up the tent and we were only our second day into the trip. Fortunately we had two nights here, I had booked the campsite with the boys in mind. It was Butlinsesque with a large swimming pool, restaurants, a mini supermarket and a playground all located around a central hub. So after setting up the tent we drove to that area, it was about a half mile walk and had an explore. Asher was extremely excited to go swimming the next day.

The next morning we headed to Carrefour in a nearby town as I needed new swimming trunks. I bought shorts. Short shorts. Very short shorts. We also bought water wings for the boys and spent the whole day in the myriad of pools on offer. The sheer delight on the boys faces as they spent hours in the water. Caleb went down a water slide over and over and over again. Asher would jump into the water with his water wings and 'swim' to the side. He was so disappointed to have to leave the pool at the end of the day. Caitlyn got horribly sunburnt on her back and both boys got burnt on their faces, I somehow avoided the burn.

I discovered a lemonade and beer mix in cans and have become obsessed. Searching for the brand I drank I just found this review of it on the internet.

_"I love vacation, I sail and this tasty refreshing Radler fits in perfectly. Be nice if the Alc content were a bit higher. My taste buds burn out on beer fast - definitely not a quantity drinker in that respect but I can drink Radler all day. For you boaters out there, serve it with breakfast, hove to somewhere like Cuttyhunk - morning, coffee, Eggs Benedict, the smell of the ocean- you'll know what I'm talking about."_

Not sure about the sailing and breakfast part, but definitely agree with the 'I can drink Radler all day.' Which was why it was probably a good thing that we left the following day. As we set down the tent I thought to myself, only four more times of doing this before we're back in England. Caitlyn took the boys to ride the 'train' which ferried campers around the campsite to allow me to set down without them distracting me. By the time they'd returned I'd just about finished and Asher was very excited about riding on the train and couldn't stop telling me all about it.

The next step of our journey took us north towards Gava just south of Barcelona. The weather was a little cooler, only the low 30s this time. Everytime hills loomed on the horizon I got nervous our car wouldn't be able to make it over them. It ruined the drive a little as I was quite anxious about breaking down, although I had nothing to be worried about in the end. As we got close to Gava there were similarities with the Central Californian coast, with its rugged hills and towns nestled in bays. The boys made a mess of Calippos in the car, well Beets did, he was covered in sticky strawberry flavoured mess, it didn't bother him one bit.

Gava campsite was on the coast in a grove of large pine trees, it was a lovely setting but was rather dishevelled. There was chaos at reception as we arrived at the same time as a large group who didn't have a booking. There was one funny moment in the reception when a man walked in only wearing swimming trunks, the girl behind the counter said in English 'Excuse me sir, can you please put a shirt on,' and she pointed to a sign showing people wearing swimming costumes with a big red cross through them. He looked at her a little confused and she said it again a little more forcefully. By now everyone in reception was looking at him to see how he would respond.  
'No entiendo' he responded in Spanish and everyone began to laugh. They had a conversation where she must have told it was ok to stay, as he didn't leave or put a shirt on. I guess there are different rules for locals.

Once we finally got our pitch we started to put up the tent and were attacked by mosquitoes. I would find one brazenly sucking my blood on my foot, smash it only to find another on my calf. It was definitely time to get out the mosquito repellent. This was the first time I had used it since we'd left England as I didn't use it once in Morocco. Having rebuffed the mosquitoes, at least momentarily we finished putting the tent up. It was so muggy and I was sure it would be a wretched night writhing in sweat. As with every night so far this trip Asher took ages to fall asleep and kept getting out of the tent. So we went for a stroll along the beach and watched the aeroplanes flying low overhead having just taken off. Most nights it took over an hour for him to finally settle by which time Caitlyn and I were normally ready for bed.

Our book for the road trip home was [Birds Without Wings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3399.Birds_Without_Wings). I am indebted to the many soporific hours Caitlyn read to me whilst we drove, although her reading had the opposite effect on me. We had started it in Morocco and finished it on our final drive of the trip. After reading it I am obsessed with the fall of the Ottoman Empire.

The next day we drove into France and soon after left the dry heat of the Mediterranean coast and headed north towards the cooler climbs of the Massif Central. The landscape became lusher and the greens were richer with fewer browns. We stopped off at a lookout point above Millau, which I was never sure how to pronounce, it was great to get out of the car and stretch the legs and take in the amazing view. Asher bombed it about and Beets tried to keep up but fell over countless times, his pigeon-toed run, although rather springy is incredibly unsteady. He's a good sport and most times he'd pick himself up and toddle off again before coming crashing down a few steps later.

The view was incredible with the town below with the Dourbie Valley to the east topped with rocky buttresses and forest, the enormous Viaduct stood impressively behind the town. The campsite was on the river Dourbie just before it merged with the Tarn. Our pitch was grassy and had mature trees for shade. We set up the tent and the boys went to the playground, they were so excited to use the swimming pool. As it was late they had to wait for the next day. For once they fell asleep pretty quickly, leaving Caitlyn and me to enjoy a peaceful evening. This campsite was going to be our home for the next 5 days and we were so excited to be able to stay in one place and not have to put down the tent and load the car come morning.

The next day we headed into Millau, how do you pronounce it again? It was a 20 minute walk, the bridge over the Tarn river was a beautiful spot, located just upstream from the confluence of it and the Dourbie. The centre was a tangle of narrow alleys, filled with bars, restaurants, cafes and galleries. Caitlyn and I enjoyed being able to soak in the atmosphere and we stopped at a cafe and had a pastry and coffee. Asher was itching to get back to the campsite so he could go swimming. The river was our first destination, it had a rocky beach and we found a sunny spot to sit. Caleb sat in the shallows throwing stones and playing with his lorry whilst Caitlyn and I took turns to go swimming with Asher. There was a small rapid a little further upstream, I sat on a rubber ring with Asher on my lap. I hit so many stones on my way down that next time I put Asher on his own rubber ring and followed after him. Asher was in his happy place, he loves being in water. After a couple of hours by the river we headed to the swimming pool, there was a baby pool which Beets stayed in and the bigger pool which Asher couldn't get enough of. With his water wings he was able to stay afloat in the water by himself and would swim lap after lap after lap. I had to literally drag him from the pool when it was time for dinner.

The following day we breakfasted on fresh pastries and then drove to Chateau Peyrelade at the mouth of the Tarn gorge. The castle sits perilously atop a rocky outcrop, it looks like it grew directly from it and has magnificent views. Asher loved it and kept on asking about knights and if we would see any. He loved climbing up the tower and we ran about shooting each other with pretend bows and arrows.

![](images/IMG_2614-1024x768.jpg)

  
That evening we headed to Millau to take in the Bastille Day festivities, we wandered about the winding alleys with the throng of people. The bars and restaurants were overflowing and our passage slowed and narrowed from the deluge of revellers. In a square we sat and ate ice cream, after which the boys ran around. Caitlyn and I looked on admiringly as they merrily chased each other. When night fell I asked in my best French 'Ou est les feu d'artifice' and followed the directions and the rest of the crowd. On the bank of the Tarn we sat on a curb waiting with the multitude, soaking in the atmosphere of the balmy night. Caitlyn had brought glow sticks for Asher and Beets which had the twofold advantage of keeping them entertained and visible to us in case they wandered off into the throng. The firework display was incredible and went on for a long time. Why oh why Guy Fawkes did you have to try and blow up parliament in November, couldn't you have done it in August.

The following day we took the road to Montpellier-le-Vieux which climbed steeply from Millau. It wound its way through pine forests until it reached a plateau, where the forest thinned out and meadows appeared. The park is made up of distorted towers and craggy outcrops of black limestone. Paths wound through the arid landscape and we trundled along their dusty courses, although the boys wanted to be carried quite a bit. It was searingly hot and we were thankful for having brought quite a bit of water with us. A lot of the outcrops and towers had names and as we meandered along we'd come round a bend and see a colossal bit if rock before us. It was an awe inspiring place to be and each edifice had a name, my favourite was Queen Victoria, which looked like a profile of her face.

Over the last few years Caitlyn and I have become avid fans of cycling, so part of the reason for booking this campsite was because a stage of the Tour de France was passing only an hours drive away. In the morning we packed a picnic and headed towards the town of Saint-Geniez-d'Olt. As we got closer we saw campervans parked by the side of the road with people sitting on camping chairs outside them. We stopped in a layby where two campervans were already parked up. There were two old couples sitting on camping chairs, probably in their late 60s and they had a grandson with them. They were very genial and put up with us and our nescient foreign ways with lots of grace. Another car pulled up and a family got out with two boys of about 8 and 10. The layby was on a bend and had decent views of the road either end of it, the only downside being it was on a descent which meant the riders would be flying when they came past. The sun was out but the tall trees behind the layby offered plenty of shade, we put a blanket on the grass for the boys to read and colour on whilst we waited. An open top car passed by a few minutes later with a couple of people harnessed in the back of it and they threw out free newspapers, which the other people in our layby descended on like a pack of wolves. As there were more papers than people they handed a couple to us. The paper was in French and I gave up reading it after awhile. One of the older ladies disappeared into her campervan and came out with two magazines which she'd obviously collected from a previous stage and kindly gave them to the boys. A gendarme's car drove by followed by a van with a big digital sign saying the road was now closed. Then followed team car after team car, hurrying hectically after the one in front with their wheels screeching as they rounded the bend. The odd motorbike would come past and more gendarme when finally after about an hour of the road being closed the advertising caravan started. Around 10 minutes before the caravan arrived the older couples crossed the road with their grandson and set up their camping chairs on the verge. The family of four spread out about 5 metres apart along the side of the road starting from the middle of the layby to the end of it. Like sheep we adopted the same formation as the others unquestioningly except that we spread out towards the start of the layby. I put Beets on my shoulders in preparation. I thought we had missed the caravan and expected the peloton to come zooming past. Instead the first car, if you can call it a car, of the caravan arrived. It had a giant sculpture of a rider in the yellow jersey with a large yellow helmet. What followed was a myriad of sponsors' cars, often with a garish sculpture depicting their product. The sponsors' cars came in groups of five followed by a few cars and motorbikes, containing dignitaries of some sort, before the next five sponsored cars, this arrangement continued for the rest of the caravan. The sponsors' cars were blaring music with people throwing tat out to the spectators on the side of the road. This is where the fun began as with each keyring or bag or inflatable travel pillow that was thrown out, we, the spectators would scrabble around trying to grab them before the next person. As we were in a place where there were not too many spectators it was easy to pick up the things thrown out. I can only imagine the carnage that would ensue in a crowded place. Asher got really into it and was dashing about like a man possessed trying to pick up everything and anything that was thrown out.

![](images/IMG_2645-1024x768.jpg)

  
With Beets on my shoulder I was rather handicapped in this regard, but could wave and shout at each passing car.

![](images/IMG_2646-768x1024.jpg)

  
There must have been close to 200 hundred cars in total and by the time the caravan had ended we were elated, Asher was ecstatic with our hoard if not a little tired. He had an absolute blast and was pleading for more cars to come.

![](images/IMG_2650-768x1024.jpg)

  
The older couples crossed back over the road with their grandson, each carrying a shopping bag full of the same dross that we had collected. Sitting in front of their campers they chatted away as they looked through their trove. After about an hour it was action stations again in the layby, some of the old people crossed back over the road and soon after a few motorbikes zoomed by. Then the breakaway of about 7 riders came round the corner and was upon us and gone within a blink of an eye. I only recognised Barguil. They were going so fast. Shame they weren't going uphill. We knew the peloton was approaching a couple of minutes later by the sound of the helicopters. It swept past us and I couldn't make out anyone in it and my hat got blown off by a helicopter that had come in for a shot. The only thing I could hear above the roar of its engine were Beets' screams of terror. Then followed the pandemonium of the team cars, jostling for position as they were trying to keep up with the riders. I would be interested to know how many crashes the team cars are involved in during the tour, must be a couple a day at least. Asher couldn't stop talking about cycling on the drive back to the campsite, he was so excited to get back to Leicester and go for a bike ride.

My brother-in-law is on his third, I know a couple of people who lost theirs on their honeymoon. It took me just over 7 years, I was sitting on an inflatable ring going down rapids with Beets on my lap and put my left hand into the water to paddle and it slipped off.

Gone.

I loved my wedding ring so I was gutted to lose it. It was difficult to look for it as the river was flowing so fast at that spot. My goggles kept filling up with water which made a hard task almost impossible. I used to have this habit of touching my ring with the thumb on my left hand, I must have done it subconsciously, now when I do it I feel loss.

A couple of friends who we knew from Leicester were staying in the same campsite as us. It was refreshing to be able to chat with people we knew well and not have the conversation we'd had umpteen times in Morocco, about how long we were planning to be in Morocco and what were we going to do for work etc. So it was with heavy hearts that we packed up our tent one morning and headed north.

Our next campsite was west of Paris in a town called Rambouillet. The campsite was in a forest, our pitch was under its umbrous canopy. I longed for the sweltering and fulgent climate of the south of France. It was a nice couple of days there although Caitlyn and I were ready to get back to England. Asher loved when we hired bikes for a day and got to 'race' us through paved tracks that led through the forest.

The day we left for Calais was dreary with an ashen sky. Soon after we'd left the campsite it began to rain, it took us awhile to work out the last time we'd seen rain. It was over a month before when we'd been in Tangier. I began to feel depressed with the weather, low dark clouds scudded the horizon and there were intermittent heavy showers all the way to Calais. When we got out the car at the port to stretch our legs it was gusty and stormy and I felt very underdressed in my short shorts. I may have even begun to shiver. The voyage across the Channel was a little surreal, suddenly being surrounded by English people after four months, I wished I was still in Morocco. Normally I'm excited when I come back to England after a holiday, but it felt different this time. I think it was because our time in Morocco felt unfinished or at least Caitlyn and I weren't sure whether we would be going back there. It had always been our plan to move to Morocco and now that dream seemed to have gone, I didn't want to come back to England, to my old my life, I was hoping for a change of location, which won't be happening for the foreseeable future.

I was so desperate to get back to Leicester and to see my brother and family, only for us to get a puncture. I pulled over immediately and saw the back left was flat. I knew the spare was flat, we'd had a puncture in Morocco and before we left I thought to myself I should get it sorted but scorned that plan. For some reason I didn't scorn renewing my breakdown membership a few days before. As an aside, I didn't have European breakdown cover, if we'd had a problem there, we'd probably still be there now. We got out the car and waited on a grassy bank for the breakdown lorry to come, I was in surprisingly high spirits and so were the boys as they saw cars and lorries roaring past.

![](images/breakdown.jpg)

  
The RAC van came within the hour and he was able to fix my tyre with a plug and was amazed that I'd made it to Morocco with the family in the A Class. The rest of the drive I expected the tyre to burst everytime we hit a bump in the road or a cats eye. Relief at reaching my brothers soon gave way to jubilant scenes of seeing our families for the first time in over 7 months. The next few days we spent catching up with one another before heading to Cornwall to see my parents where the car finally hit 170000 miles.
