Hours of travelling, unpacking and cold, it was so cold. I had been irritable for most of the the journey back from California. Finally I was going to get respite from weary screaming children, everyone was in bed fast asleep.

I was just starting to drift off.

I heard a thump followed by the pitter patter of feet, a door swing open, the pitter patter of feet louder now on the landing outside our bedroom and then our bedroom door fly open.

'DAD-DEE!'

This cannot be happening. I looked at the clock 11.23. I had been in bed 12 minutes. Asher's loud and excitable voice woke up Caleb who started to cry. Cursing under my breath I crawled out of bed in a fog and carried both boys downstairs.

'Play with me Daddy.'

'In a minute Asher.'

I sat Caleb next to me on the sofa and tried to engage Asher as he handed me a lego man. It was like playing with a Jack Russell, he kept on bounding up to me before running off to get another toy. He wanted to sit on my lap, to climb on me and pretend I was a motorbike. I don't know how I didn't throttle him, I was so irritated, especially when he pulled Caleb's leg and made him cry. After a couple of hours playing I finally managed to convince Asher to go back to sleep. I handed Caleb to Caitlyn and lay down and longed to be back in California.

Our holiday in California started in a bit of blur, we drove to Heathrow on Christmas morning. The roads were clear as you would expect, although I did pass a broken down car on the side of the road, it must be the worst day to breakdown. Asher had decided to fight sleep on the plane and with 10 minutes left of the 11 hour flight he finally lost the battle. I had to carry him off the plane, I could have dropped him and he probably wouldn't have woken up.

A taxi picked us up from the airport to take us to Caitlyn's parents' house. Asher slept the whole way, Caleb cried. We arrived around 7pm, enough time to have something to eat and chat with the family and let them hold Caleb as most of them had never seen him before. After the initial excitement turned to exhaustion we made our way to bed around 10.30.

Asher woke up at 11.15.

This was going to be the worse night ever, 45 minutes sleep!! He got into our bed and slept until 2.30 which was a relief, I then got up with him and Caleb and played with them til morning. It took a couple more nights before we were able to get Asher to sleep through the night. Caleb never got the hang of it and was up every few hours every night of the holiday.

I flew on Christmas day once before to surprise Caitlyn in 2009. When I landed it was close to 30°C and I was hoping for the same this trip. However it stayed in the low teens in the day and the temperature hovered around freezing at night. It was too cold to sit outside in the sun reading and I didn't get to don a pair of shorts and show off my pasty white legs.

A few days after we arrived we headed to Joshua Tree with Caitlyn's family for a walk around [Hidden Valley.](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g143037-d531721-Reviews-Hidden_Valley-Joshua_Tree_National_Park_California.html) Joshua Tree is incredible. I wasn't sure what to expect but I was blown away by the place as we drove in and saw the trees and unusual granite rock formations. The colour of the sky was a rich blue, the light was so clear. The whole landscape made it seem as if we were on another world, there is an eeriness about the place. The walk through the Hidden Valley was crowded, which I suppose is part and parcel of living in Southern California. It's a shame really as it took away the remoteness of the place.

On New Year's Day we flew to Spokane via Portland to go skiing in Schweitzer, Idaho with my family. To get on the propeller plane for Spokane at Portland we had to walk across the tarmac, snow and ice had been shovelled to the side so we could walk to the plane, it was bitterly cold. Once we were in the air the whole landscape turned white, the Cascades with their craggy peaks were imposing and haunting in the fading light, once on the otherside of them the featureless flat plain was bleak with the odd road cutting a straight line through the landscape. In Spokane we had to walk across the tarmac again it was 5°C below freezing and we rushed inside as quickly as we could. We had hired a car for the hour and a half drive to Schweitzer. I took Asher with me with some of the suitcases to load the car up. There was snow on the ground and the inside of the car was freezing. It took awhile for it to heat up and Asher was crying because his hands were cold, poor little sausage had picked up some snow and was now regretting it. I had to scrape the ice and snow off the windows which took a good five minutes, by the time I finished my hands were numb. I picked up Caitlyn and Caleb and off we went, relieved to be out of the cold.

I've already mentioned my love of driving in America in previous [posts,](http://thecroggy.com/usa/) it is so intuitive and enjoyable. Being able to turn right on a red light. Why don't we do the equivalent here? We had a Chevy Impala and once I got over my fear of black ice on the roads I felt at home. We drove on the main highway from Spokane to Couer d'Alene and then headed north on [Highway 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_95_in_Idaho) which was a lot smaller, one lane each way with the occasional dual carriageway section. A brief stop to a McDonalds drive-thru because we are in America. It was too dark to see the world outside and we didn't pass many cars. Green road signs informed us we were getting closer to the Canadian border, I really hoped we weren't going the wrong way. We didn't have gps and I had taken screenshots on Caitlyn's iPhone before leaving so I just had to follow the directions and hope they were right. Before sat-navs I wouldn't have been as anxious about following the directions, not having a map added to my level of anxiety. Of course the directions were correct and right where it was meant to be was the turning for Schweitzer ski resort. This was my favourite part of the drive, the winding mountain road was in a poor condition but as I was going uphill I wasn't too concerned with skidding. I made sure I slowed down before the hairpins and sharper turns and held off attempting to drift around some of the corners. Quelle surprise! The directions led us to our cabin, we made it after 2 hours of driving. It was great to see family again and after a few hours of catching up we headed to bed as we were all weary from our day of travelling.

The cabin was incredible and this was the view which greeted us in the morning from the living room window.

I hired my snowboard first thing in the morning, on the walk back to the cabin I lost a glove which I had borrowed from a friend, fortunately I found it again on a metal sign. Phew! I didn't want to borrow them in the first place because I have a habit of ruining my clothes or losing them. After breakfast I got dressed and headed to the cloakroom which kept all the skis and jackets, once dressed there was a door leading to the outside. I put on my snowboard and followed my brother towards the slopes. I haven't snowboarded since 2008 and it felt completely unnatural to be back on one. Somehow I made it towards the piste where I had to duck under a rope marking the edge of it, there was a little ridge that sent me flying onto my hands and knees and I let out an 'oof' as I hit the snow. I felt old and wondered if I should have chosen to ski instead. I could turn on my toe edge fine but turning on my heel edge was very awkward. After a few ungainly attempts at turning it suddenly clicked and it didn't feel like 8 years since my last time on a snowboard.

The were runs so long, in some cases over two miles and freshly groomed, the weather was perfect, clear blue sky and the air so fresh and cold. As I was going up my first lift so many memories of my childhood came flooding back the sound of skis carving, the mechanical clank of the ski lift along with its smell of grease and oil, the mountain views and slight apprehension at starting my first run of the day. In fact the only smell missing was of cigarette smoke. I grew up skiing in [Le Mosses](http://images.gadmin.st.s3.amazonaws.com/n24759/images/keyvisuals/hphiverdomaineskiable-2.jpg) and the ski operator at the bottom of my favourite lift was this gnarly old man who seemed to have a cigarette glued to his mouth. Everytime I caught the lift he would check my abonnement and I would get a whiff of cigarette smoke, which I loved. It probably influenced me to take up smoking in my late teens.

There is this sense of freedom that comes with snowboarding in the mountains, any route down the mountain is open to you. The speed you pick up the air on your face the sound of the board carving the slight panic when you lost control for moment. I love attempting jumps and I consider them a success if I don't fall flat on my face, which is the standard outcome. Also when I say jump you probably are thinking of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl6xwuBJVIY) when this is closer to the [truth.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx9IF6Nj44g) I forgot how much fun snowboarding and skiing are especially when I'm able to share the experience with family, I can't wait for my children to be older so they can join me. Caitlyn and I took Asher out on skis, he was more excited about wearing a helmet and goggles, it was special to do it with him, not that he actually skied I had to keep hold of him the whole time.

We had two full days in Schweitzer before heading back to Southern California. We had a few trips to visit friends in Burbank, Crestline and then my brother and his family in Vista. Our drive to Burbank coincided with a storm, the amount of rain falling from the sky was insane. The roads had so much standing water on them making driving conditions pretty dicey and at some points the windscreen wipers couldn't keep up with the rain. We crossed the Los Angeles river which is normally just a trickle making its way along the concrete channel filled with rubbish. I got a glimpse of it as we drove over it on I5 and it was terrifying, the normally sedate river was a raging torrent this [video](https://youtu.be/nErpZVrqE2s?t=47) doesn't do it justice but it gives you some idea as to what it was like.

I planned to run a 12k trail race with my brother and sister in-law. It was going to be a warm up for my sister in-law who ran the [Calico 50k](http://www.calicotrailrun.org/) a few weeks later. Unfortunately she didn't make the trail run as her husband and children came down with the lurgee. The race was in the Santa Ana mountains, it was out in the sticks and the guy organising it was this larger than life character called Baz. He's from Coventry originally so we had a little chat about Jamie Vardy which was a bit bizarre. I had got the start time wrong so we were hanging around for awhile in temperatures close to freezing. Poor Caitlyn she didn't realise there weren't any coffee shops around so she had to hang around with the boys until I finished the race, she headed for cover in the car once the race had started. My brother Jay turned up at a more reasonable time after a brief catch-up, we were given a race briefing by Baz. I use the word race briefing loosely, it was more a profanity laden speech that got howls of laughter from the regular runners. He had us sing Happy Birthday and he cracked up when it turned out to be one of the runners birthdays. I handed over my coat to Caitlyn and shivering joined the runners for the start.

Attempting to warm up

We were towards the back of the pack and our pace was very easy, the temptation is always to start off quickly. I am a faster runner than Jay but I had decided to run it with him. There were clear skies and as soon as we started to run I warmed up and the temperature increased as the sun got higher in the sky. The rain over the previous days had eroded the trails quite badly but there weren't many puddles or muddy patches. The first few miles were generally downhill and we were chatting most of the way. We passed a few runners and then the trail started to climb, it wasn't too steep and our pace was quite slow and we continued chatting for the next couple of miles. Our chit chat became more intermittent after that as Jay began to tire. There were three runners ahead of us who we would catch as we were going uphill but they would pull away from us as we headed down hill. Jay was quite cautious on the downhills where as I am a bit more gung-ho. It was the sort of terrain I love to run on, working out where to plant my feet as I'm flying down it. On a couple of occasions I bombed it down the trail before waiting for Jay to catch up with me. The last two miles were all uphill and they were killer, Jay had to walk a few stretches. We ran the last mile with a woman who turned out to be Michelle Barton who is an accomplished ultrarunner, she has the [1:34](http://www.calicotrailrun.org/The_Course.html>course record</a> for the Calico 50K. As we approached the finish Asher and Caitlyn were cheering for us along with Baz. We finished in a time of <a href=) and it turned out the course was over 13K, Baz likes a practical joke.

After the race we went to my brothers house in Vista where Asher got to play with his cousins. It was a relaxing few days with them which included a trip to In 'n Out, afterwards we headed back to Caitlyn's parents to see out the last days of our trip.

As I lay back down having got Asher back to sleep I wondered if this holiday had been a dream, it already felt like a distant memory.
