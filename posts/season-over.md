It was a disappointing end to the season. We made it to the semi-final thanks to North Kilworth beating Kibworth four nil. I was surprised at the size of the victory until I saw that North Kilworth's first team didn't have a game but Kibworth's did. The perks of having a club big enough to field two teams.

We were pretty tame and couldn't match the energy or drive of St Patricks. They kept the ball well, they had an extra man in midfield which made it hard for Dave and I. The wind was again a factor, we played against the wind first half which meant we barely got out of our half. Their opening goal was a mis-hit pass from forty yards that sailed into the top corner.

The way their striker played made me realise how we could improve our team. He wasn't quick or skillful, he brought those around him into the game with simple balls. Whereas we hit it long and when our strikers do get the ball they don't generally lay it off, instead they try to take players on. With the players we have we wouldn't improve a huge amount but if we trained we would be a lot harder to beat and would be able to keep the ball a lot better. However that is unlikely to happen as most of us have families and it would be difficult to get players to commit to training on a weekly basis. The final score was two nil, it was a fair result especially as we didn't have a meaningful shot on goal.

##### Things on Telly

I am still on course for having watched the Stanley Cup Champions. The Ducks are currently leading the Hawks 3-2 going into tonight's game and I am tempted to stay up and watch it even though it doesn't start until one am. Tonight is also the final of the Europa League, however I am working on my loft so will probably miss a cracker of a game.

Do these arrests this morning of FIFA staff signal the death knell for Sep Blatter? Probably not, he has managed to survive for this long and he will probably weather this storm too.
