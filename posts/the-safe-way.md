Not being a particularly robust person, or if I was to describe myself in the words of some 30s author I would probably say 'lacking fortitude and dithering', harsh, perhaps, I find it best to avoid difficulties and upset, my own upset.

A mantra, one of the many mantras that I have, which aren't really mantras, more sayings I have hastily latched onto and decided give meaning to that moment, before being discarded until I resurrect them when a whim or vagary present themselves, is, when you got nothing you got nothing to lose.

Others include you don't belong here, guess I'll always have to be living in a fantasy, better to not try and fail than to try and fail, when I fall I do not get up, under no circumstance must I ask for help, I do not have needs.

I have a longing to succeed, what does that mean? I don't know, what I do know is I am not succeeding right now, failing? I think so, whatever the level of success is I will never achieve it.

There are glimpses, cracks in the protective walls, where I dare to hope, a yearning, a desire to pursue a dream, momentarily I see a wide horizon of possibility.

Quickly the view is gone, like when driving and a hedgerow obscures the view, the horizon has disappeared, replaced with an immovable object, my protective wall.

As I sruggle forward, I have to contend with the difficulties that everyone has to grapple with, I also tussle with the protective wall, not really a fight, more a brief wrestle before acquiescing to the wall.

I plod, sometimes, often stationary, struggling with this mantra or that, cracks, grietas bring a repreive and motion, short lived, but lived none the less.

It is the easy way I choose, the way which offers few hurdles, avoiding the dual duel of exogenous and endogenous adversities, the safe way.
