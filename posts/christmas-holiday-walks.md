I remember one Christmas day walk when I was fifteen. To be honest I don't remember the walk because I managed to wheedle my way out of it. My dad had taken a job on the Isle of Arran over the holidays and the whole family were meant to be climbing [Goatfell](http://www.nts.org.uk/Property/Goatfell/) in the morning to work up an appetite for Christmas lunch. Being a stroppy teenager, I couldn't think of anything worse and refused to leave my bed despite much cajoling and pleading from my parents. My stubbornness worked and they left without me. As I lay in my warm bed I imagined my siblings huffing and puffing their way up the steep hillside. Their legs going to jelly, lungs burning from the effort and the sting of the wind on their cheeks. I could hear my youngest brother's complaints about 'the stupid fell' and see my other siblings passive protestations. My parents willfully ignoring them and continuing to lead them to the top. Once they made it to the summit, a sheltered place would be found to sit and a flask of hot tea passed around along with a biscuit or two. I was more than happy to still be in bed.

It is a bizarre tradition, walking in the cold and often wet countryside and one I thought I would dispense with as soon as I became an adult. However now I enjoy the cold air on my face, leaning into the bitter wind and stumbling up a hill, there is a familiarity to it which is comforting. Also in-spite of the bad weather and cold one feels an immense satisfaction with having completed a walk. The tea and biscuits, which I devour when I get home taste that little bit better for having done the walk.

Not all days are miserable. A crisp winter's day, the sun low in the sky and the cold biting at your toes and fingers are my favourite. I just walked from Lelant to St Ives along the Coastal Path. It was a beautiful day with views along the coast to Gwithian and Godrevy Lighthouse. Cornwall has the rugged landscape that I associate with winter, there is a harshness to it.

Who would have thought that over fifteen years later I would be dragging my boy along with me?
