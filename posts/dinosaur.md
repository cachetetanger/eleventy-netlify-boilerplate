Manuel Pellegrini decided to hang up his boots at the age of thrity two when a seventeen year old boy out jumped him to score a header. I felt like hanging up my boots after our game on Saturday. They were a young team all of them teenagers or early twenties, not a beer gut in sight, full of youthful vigour and enthusiasm. We knew it was going to be tough to keep up with them for ninety minutes and the wind was blowing from one end of the pitch, which meant one half was going to be a lot harder than the other. I wanted to play into into the wind first half but Grundy disagreed and when they lost the toss he decided to go with the wind.

The ground was rock solid as it hadn't rained for over a week and I don't have any mouldies, walking to the pitch I knew I was going to have sore feet after the game. I need to get myself some mouldies but I don't want to pay Â£60 for a pair.

Straight from kick off you could tell they were a good team, they passed the ball around brightly and kept possession well. They didn't create much but we were working hard just to try and get the ball. We took the lead when Kyle missed the ball and it went through to Banzi, who played it back into the path of Kyle. Kyle tried to bulldoze his way through the centre of their defence, he lost the ball but there was a mix up with their defenders and Banzi was able to nip in and score.

Unfortunately we let them equalise almost straight away, a long ball was played over our defence. Heath and Tony got in each others way leaving their striker to roll the ball into an open net. The amount of times we have let in stupid goals this season is frustrating and part of the problem is there is an expectation we are going to be mediocre. Generally you are what you think, meaning we are mediocre and that is putting it kindly.

A moment of confusion between Dovey and I almost led to another goal for them. Heath had come out of the goal and their striker tried to go round him, Dovey and I were both going full pelt for the ball I called for it but he didn't want to take a chance and so he booted it.

I booted him.

It was probably a good thing he got there first as I was facing our goal and may well have put it into the top corner. It took him a minute to get up as I gave him a fair whack.

Banzi scored his second goal of the match, again it was thanks to Kyle although his methods weren't legal this time. Their central defender went up to head a ball away from the edge of their box, Kyle with eyes only on the defender used his considerable bulk to barge into him. The defender was completely taken out, the ball came off his back into the path of Banzi who beat the keeper one on one. Everyone was waiting for the whistle but none came, needless to say they weren't impressed with Kyle or the ref.

At half-time the score was two one, but now we had to play against the wind. It was hard going, we couldn't get out of our half and had hardly any possession. We held them at bay until the final ten minutes when our legs eventually gave up and we capitulated.

They equalised with a scrappy goal which we had a chance to clear but tired legs dallied too long and they got the break they needed. They took the lead a few minutes later and got a fourth from a sliced shot. They deserved the win but it was frustrating to be winning for eighty minutes only to concede three goals.

I felt depressed after the game and even into the next day, I had been given the run around by a bunch of kids and it made me feel old. I have felt old more than a few times on the football pitch but have not been left with this lingering depression before. Like Pellegrini before me I considered quitting, however I will give it one more season I think. The seventeen year old who out jumped Pellegrini was [Ivan Zamorano,](http://www.canoe.ca/SoccerWCImages98/jun17_chi4.jpg) unfortunately I don't think any of the boys who outplayed me are half the player he was. Kibworth play Kilworth this Saturday, Kibworth only need a point and they will take our place in the semis, so this could be my last game of the season.

##### Real Football

Another bizarre rant from Pearson which stems from the criticism he has been getting in the local press. Although Leicester haven't had much criticism nationally the local press have been unimpressed with their performances and Pearson won't do interviews with Leiceser Mercury. I think this is why he reacted the way he did it also deflects attention away from his players, makes him come across as bit unhinged too, perhaps he will go postal if they get relegated.

##### The end is nigh

The NFL draft is tonight. I can't wait for it to begin and usher in the death of mock drafts, honestly is there anything more pointless. The amount of hours spent analysing something that hasn't happened, it can only happen in a sport which has an offseason of eight months. Now only one hundred and twenty six days until the season starts.
