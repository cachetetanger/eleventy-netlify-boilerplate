"Who comes to Yosemite National Park and chops down a tree?" I'd seen the dead tree topple over out of the corner of my eye, before hearing its crash. Jason and I watched from a distance as two men in their 60s set to cutting it into logs. Jason continued "They've got to be European, who wears a purple fleece and cargo shorts?"

Three episodes of Blaze, the garish monster truck, is all Bito wanted to watch. Over and over again he watched them. After four hours of it, he had developed a vacant stare and was desperate to fall asleep, but Blaze is like crack to a 3 year old. I eventually had to turn it off, suffer through the ensuing meltdown before finally exhausted he mercifully fell asleep. When we landed and the entertainment system was turned off, Bito burst into tears. He was distraught and no matter what I said I could not console him. The power of Blaze.

Eating lunch after a leisurely hike, my father-in-law turned to me and said, 'We're 6000 feet higher than Snowdon.'  
'That may be, but you can't say you've just hiked the highest mountain in a country.'

The cost of our weekly shop in America was three or four times more than it was in the England. I can't work out why, especially as a lot of the fruit and veg is grown there. Cheese costs a bomb too, which is a surprise as [stockpiles of cheese are at an all-time high.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/28/americas-cheese-stockpile-just-hit-an-all-time-high/?utm_term=.9d80eeaab88e) It is also the first time I have been to America and not particularly enjoyed the food. Usually it is one of the highlights of the trip, however the banality and excess of it grew wearisome. The simple life giving value of food has been lost by the way it is wrought. Not to say that food is not wrought in England, it's just that I'm used to the way it's wrought. I pray I never see a corndog again, something inside me died when I saw how much Asher loved them.

I was not looking forward to hiking up [Lembert Dome](https://www.yosemitehikes.com/tioga-road/lembert-dome/gallery-lembert-dome.htm) with 9 children, only one of them over the age of 10. It was the dreaded grumbling and moaning and attempted cajoling before the inevitable losing of tempers and crying. You can imagine my amazement when we made it to the top without a whinge or a whine. The tonic, nay the Elixir, for that is what it was, to their fussing was stories. Yes, stories. I don't know how it worked. But the children were so mesmerised listening to the stories that their aunts and uncles weaved that they completely forgot they were walking up something over twice as high than this island has to offer. It must be said, without wishing to sound disrespectful, that my brothers and sisters-in-law are no raconteurs, yet Homer would have been proud of their efforts that day.

Most mornings after getting the boys breakfast, I would stand in the driveway and let the heat of the sun wash over me. Feeling its warmth on my face and body invigorated me. It brought back memories of my childhood, it felt very familiar.

'Uncle Tom, there is room for you.' We were having a picnic lunch and my nephew was inviting me onto the blanket that had been laid in the shade of a large leafy tree. I'd scooted out of its shade into the sun as I felt a little chilled. It was the first time I'd felt chilled in over 8 weeks.

It only rained once when I was in there, it was during our time camping in Tuolumne. Low menacing clouds unleashed an immense burst of hail the size of peas. We tried to shelter under a few lodgepole pine, the cover they provided was negligible. Mercifully the barrage was over after 10 minutes, thunder still rumbled nearby and lightning crackled, for a while afterwards the atmosphere felt a little charged. The clouds moved over swiftly and a patch of brighter sky was overhead, the children then played and we ate a breezy picnic.

For my birthday present my in-laws gave me $100 and agreed to babysit Asher and Caleb so I could go to Vegas with Caitlyn(and Sequoia). It meant I got to go on a long road trip with Caitlyn(and Sequoia). We set off after breakfast and headed east on the 91, the opposite way to most of the traffic. One feels rather smug when they see traffic crawling the on the otherside of the motorway.  We took the 15 North over the San Bernadino Mountains, which at points the was incredibly steep, but we made it over fine in the Prius. It's Caitlyn's mum's car and it was incredibly generous of her to lend it to us, not only for this trip but the whole summer. Especially when you consider we have three small children, whose express intent at times seems to create as much mess and damage as possible to their surroundings.

As we went further east the temperature got steadily hotter, one stop in the Mojave was baking. I loved it, I could feel myself wilting in the sun. The landscape was barren, except for the patches of Joshua trees. The Nevada border looms up in the distance, large buildings floating like a mirage on either side of the freeway. Welcome to the town of Primm, where you can stop to gamble as soon as you arrive in Nevada. It was sickening seeing casinos so obviously set up to prey on people. This feeling was compounded by the fact that Caitlyn was reading a book called [Sabbath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4760578-sabbath), which was espousing delight, in one's surroundings and company. To slow down, embrace the beauty of your milieu, commune deeply with those you love and to feast. Here we were, doing the complete opposite, heading to a place that has the express intent to perniciously leach away everything edifying about mankind, leaving brokenness, emptiness and destruction. It is a monument to our conceit and I came to sample it.

The thing that struck me immediately was the grim reality of Las Vegas, we stopped at a Starbucks to buy a coffee and use their free wifi. On the pavement outside were a number of people who looked to be rough sleepers, if not every night at least some of the time and they were all high. However when we were on the strip there was barely a sniff of the social issues the city struggles with. It reminded me of Morocco, where in the tourist areas the police keep away the 'dark' side of the society to keep the tourist experience positive.

One thing I was surprised by as we wandered with the masses was the number of families that were there. Obviously I am being hypocritical as I had a baby with me, but dragging young families about the casinos is something I don't understand. As it got later, there were kids crying and kids with a glazed look in their eyes, whole families looked plain miserable. After a while the casinos began to blend into one another, we spent about 6 hours walking through many of them. When we finally made it back to our hotel room, we were both worn out, our feet and legs ached.

The drive back was spectacular, we took a turn off the 15 and headed onto a stretch of Route 66. The sun was low in the sky,  the landscape had a rich titian glow. We pulled over and got out of the car, it was still hot and I absorbed the heat and beauty around us. This scene may have been idyllic but Sequoia was screaming in the back of the car. The things pictures don't tell you.
