Asher my two year old boy woke me up at 6.15, half an hour before my alarm. I knew there wasn't any chance of getting him back to bed so I got out of bed in a haze, got dressed and took him downstairs for breakfast. At least with the earlier than expected wake up call I would get to spend a few more minutes with him. After breakfast of porridge, fruit, coffee and tea for Asher, he insists on it, so I make him a very weak decaf one. We went upstairs to wake up 'Mummy and baby Caleb.' Caleb was not yet a week old and I was off to watch the opening two days of the Ashes in Cardiff. Aside from leaving during labour there wasn't a worse time to abandon the three of them. I left with a heavy heart hoping the two days would go smoothly for my wife, especially as Asher's behaviour had become more erratic since the birth of Caleb. After a teary goodbye I forlornly got into the car and started the long drive to Cardiff. Low lying grey cloud fouled the country darkening my already downcast mood and there were a few spots of rain on the windscreen as I headed out of Leicester.

Soon after joining the M50 I passed over a bridge and could see a [quarry](http://www.severn-boating.co.uk/ryal.htm) on the banks of the Severn. It was strange seeing industry on a river, it is something that seems to be from a bygone era.

The drive took me near Goodrich Castle and Symonds Yat, places I went to quite often as a child. Memories flooded back of summer days canoeing down the Wye and playing hide and seek in the castle. I am looking forward to doing the same with my children when they are a bit older.

The sky started to brighten just before I hit the M4 and as I came up a hill a picturesque golf course with a fairway in between two small woods stood out against the brightening sky. The clouds were no longer grey but white cumulus clouds and the landscape was your stereotypical rolling hills with patches of forest that these isles offer.

I found the hotel without any difficulty. I got rid of my smartphone and bought a naff Nokia so now when I get lost I have to find my way out of it without the help of Google Maps. The cricket ground was about a mile away and the walk was pleasant. I walked down Cathedral Road, which reminded me a lot of the Circus in Bath, it is lined with trees and the houses are built of similar stone. There were also quite a number of dentists and clinics which the Circus has too, well at least one dentist because that is where I used to go.

I got to the ground at 11.30, there was only one tout trying to sell me a ticket. The roads were almost empty, cricket fans are a punctual lot. I could hear the noise of leather on willow as I made my way around the main stand to the steps that led to my entry point. The grass on the outfield was immaculate and there was a soft babble of noise in the stadium, I found my parents, took my seat and settled in for the day.

It was my first test match and I was full of nervous energy, seeing the players in real life, the wicket keeper standing so far back, Michael Clarke standing in the slips with his arms crossed. The ball travels so fast from the quickies to the batsmen it is hard to pick up, especially as we were seated at square leg. The amount of beer being consumed around me was incredible, pint after pint, round after round, it wasn't cheap either. The noise level increased in line with the amount of beer drunk, by the last session the crowd was boisterous and as England were doing well each boundary was greeted heartily by the crowd. One of the biggest cheers from the crowd was when the stewards escorted an inebriated man out, he was so drunk he could barely walk.

Joe Root and Steve Smith looked incredible in the middle, a step up from the other batsmen. Root had a reprieve on nought when he was dropped by Haddin and Smith was looking was dangerous until he got himself out. I expect them to score buckets of runs this summer. There was a lot of chants poking fun at players, however I was surprised by how much vitriol directed towards Shane Watson, especially from the Australians. It was quite horrible to hear especially as it was delivered with such venom. Maybe it was an act of mercy that he was dropped for the second test, getting out twice LBW sadly sums up his career, I felt sorry for the guy, even if he has brought a lot of it on himself.

That evening we went to [Mint and Mustard](http://www.mintandmustard.com/) for a curry. The best curry I have had. I ordered swordfish in a mango sauce, it was delectable. If you are ever in Cardiff I can't recommend eating there enough.

Moeen Ali's seventy-seven livened up the morning and helped to arouse those who were a bit tender from a night on the beers. The biggest cheer of the morning came when Broad hit Johnson back down the ground for four which brought up a hundred off Johnson's bowling. He got a standing ovation bigger than Joe Root's century and to be fair to Johnson he doffed his hat in acknowledgement.

I thoroughly enjoyed my two days at the cricket but at the back of my mind was my wife, knowing that she was struggling to cope with two. I left half an hour before the close of play to beat the traffic. I walked briskly back to the hotel with my parents, we said our goodbyes and I headed off. The drive back was straightforward and I was relieved to make it home and to see my wife and Caleb. I crept into my son's room and watched him sleeping for a few minutes before heading to bed myself.
