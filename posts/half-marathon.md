I played for Park End on Saturday, we were playing pretty well and took a one nil lead early in the second half only for us to let in three goals in about ten minutes. After that we threw loads of bodies up front but could not get a goal back and despite the pressure we only created half chances. Just before the end of the game I felt my calf begin to cramp up and I thought it might impact my half marathon on Sunday. However come Sunday after a tiny bit of discomfort during my warm up it didn't bother me for the rest of the race.

I did a warm down and stretched after football which I don't normally do, I had Asher helping me with the stretches. I ate a load on Saturday night trying to [carbo load](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-e5y-3dyUs) myself to the max!

Asher woke me up at 6.30 and we had a big breakfast of oats and weetabix followed by a pain au chocolat each. I didn't have any nerves in the morning, I normally do before doing something new for the first time. I'd done quite a bit of training leading up to the race and had done a ten mile run in just over seven minute miles which gave me some confidence. I read an [article](http://fittish.deadspin.com/steve-jones-raw-starting-and-finishing-a-marathon-does-1735884995) about Steve Jones who said that using watches and technology keeps us within our limits when running. This convinced me to do the half marathon without my watch.

The nerves hit when we got to Victoria Park and seeing all the other runners warming up. It was a clear autumnal day with a chill in the air, I shuddered a few times from the cold. I did a little warm up run and found a bush to take a wazz in, I ended up going to the loo three times before the start of the race. With a few minutes to go before the start I said goodbye to my wife and kids and joined the runners waiting for the race to begin. There was quite a lot of nervous energy, some people were hopping from foot to foot, others were doing last minute stretches. With a minute to go we all started to move forward in shuffling steps, I was about fifty metres from the start line. The siren went off, my initial reaction was to start running but I had to wait for the runners in front of me to start moving. At first we all crept forward stop start stop start like rush hour traffic, I was finally able to start running about thirty metres from the start line.

I had to check my speed as I was stuck behind a slower runner and it wasn't until about fifty metres further on when a space opened up in front of me that I was able to run at what I felt was race pace. As we ran down London Road a few people made their way through the field but for the most part we were all going at a similar pace. I was surprised at how long it took for faster runners to go off into the distance, over two miles they only made about twenty seconds on me. The runners around me became familiar, some with awkward running styles, one mad had a bad a mullet of long grey curly hair, one woman looked to be running in hot pants, one guy panting already.

I settled into a rhythm after a few minutes and made my way past a few slower runners before seeing a man and woman in an orange shirts about 20 metres further on going at the same speed as me and they became my reference point. As we approached the first mile marker there were beeps from gps watches all around me followed by quick glances. We got onto Melton Road and I was feeling great, the crowds had thinned out by this point and there were quite a few curious looks from a few of the locals and some cheers as well. There was a car stuck at a petrol station, it couldn't get out because of the runners, it must have waited for a good twenty minutes longer for all the runners to come by.

Approaching 2 miles more beeps, still feeling good.

Approaching 3 miles more beeps and the first water station, grab a glass of cold water on the first attempt and glug most of it.

Orange shirted couple still twenty metres ahead of me, feeling great everyone around me is still familiar and no-one moving away from each other, everyone is going at a similar pace. Although now there are gaps further ahead of me as the field has strung out along the road, I daren't look behind.

No walking was allowed in the first four miles, beeping of watches and more stolen glances as we approach four miles and a Chinese girl in a hoody holding a water bottle starts to walk.

Five miles in, still feeling great and starting to move up through the field. I recognise the guy running ahead of me, Pete he played football for Park End. We have a brief chat, he is wearing a gps watch, I ask him what pace we're doing and he says we're averaging 6.43 minute miles. He asked what time I was aiming for and I said one hour thirty and he said that is 6.52 minute mile pace. I thought to myself, I am nearly a minute ahead of schedule I feel great, I gave Pete a 'see you later' and bombed on.

I was running with a woman as we approached six miles, another water station this time I knocked the cup out of the hand of the first guy but managed to get a cup from someone further down the line. The course soon turned into Watermead Park and Pete caught up with me. I was just starting to feel it in my legs but my breathing was fine. Pete chatted and I was able to respond.

Mile 7 I lost half a step to Pete at this point I realised I was beginning to struggle. Over the next mile I lost about twenty metres to him. The route through Watermead Park follows a narrow tarmac path and there were a number of people walking dogs or riding their bikes. It probably became quite irritating for them as they kept on having to get off the path into the bushes to allow runners by.

How many Sunday morning walks were ruined?

The course left Watermead Park and turned right up a short hill into Birstall. This was the point where I realised I was shot. My legs were empty, it was a struggle to lift up my knees and as I rounded a corner at the end of the hill Pete had doubled the distance between us. My breathing was fine, it was my legs and this is when I realised I had five miles to go and it was going to be hell.

Soon after I heard footsteps coming up it took them awhile to catch me up but they flew past me and were soon catching up a small group of people who were further down the road. At Red Hill roundabout I could no longer see anyone ahead of me and I was really struggling, the route came off the main road and into a park and I glimpsed the Space Centre and thought 'I can't believe how faraway I am from Vicky Park'. This is when I was on an island, all alone in my thoughts trying to muster up the courage to keep going through the pain. My pace must have dropped to close to 8 minute miles at this point. My legs were killing me and I began to walk and a few people ran past me. After a minute of walking I started to run again and a group of three people ran past me and I tried to keep up with them but after a few metres they were already pulling away.

I didn't realise it at the time but I had missed the 9 Mile marker and was thinking not only am I hurting but I must be going so slow as this 8th mile is taking me ages. People ran past me in their droves which only added to my misery, although quite a number of them shouted words of encouragement to me. I walked jogged the rest of the way and didn't overtake one more person and every small incline was hellish.

New Walk turned into Everest. At this point I started to get cramp in my hamstrings, I've never experienced that before and it meant my running was barely faster than my walking. By this point all dignity was lost, I felt horrendous and I must have looked absolutely horrifying to the crowds of people lining New Walk. My uneven gait and glazed over eyes led someone to ask if I was doing ok?

I couldn't muster a response and let alone any irritation I may have felt at such a stupid question. I was relieved to reach the top of New Walk and made my way back to the start line.

Caitlyn and Asher were holding signs, his face lit up when he saw me. Caitlyn had braved the cold with Asher and Caleb to support me and I felt incredibly loved.

I crossed the line and made my way to someone handing out water bottles and bananas. I chugged my water and struggled to peel my banana before wolfing it down. I felt light headed and ill, I picked up my goodybag, found Caitlyn and muttered something incomprehensible.

I couldn't talk.

Caitlyn found extra food in the goodybag and I gobbled it up. We made our way slowly to the car and it took me a good few minutes before I spoke again.

I was a bit disappointed with my time, after 8 miles I was on track but couldn't keep it going. My collapse was probably due to a number of factors, I played football the day before, I had a cold and I started too quickly. I finished in 1:42, 7.45 minute miles, I've run 10 miles at 7.07 pace so I will have to come back next year, not play football the day before and crack 1:30.
