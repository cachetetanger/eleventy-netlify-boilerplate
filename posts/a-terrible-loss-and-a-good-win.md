I usually start with Park End but this week I think it is only right that I begin with the NFC Championship Game. I still can't believe Green Bay lost. I don't think they could believe they were 16 points up against one of the best defences the NFL has ever seen. Although 16 points never felt like enough and it should have been more, they had to settle for two field goals on the Seattle one yard line. It looked to me like the Green Bay players knew at some point there was going to be an onslaught from the Seahawks and not scoring more points on those two drives would cost them.

There were a number of key moments that contributed to Green Bay's loss, because that is what it was, a Green Bay loss. I am not taking anything away from an incredible Seattle comeback, but ultimately Green Bay lost a game they should have won. The key moment for me was in the third quarter. Green Bay only rushed two on 3rd and 19. Wilson had so much time to pick the pass to Baldwin, he was never under any pressure. If there was a moment for strong leadership an aggressive play call this was it, instead Green Bay closed in on itself. This is the NFL, nobody completes a 3rd and 19. This is when the momentum shifted and Green Bay could not wrestle it back. This was followed by [mistake after mistake after mistake.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-ts=1421782837&x-yt-cl=84359240&feature=player_detailpage&v=i3O-kYwM8qY#t=72)

That completion led to the fake field goal from which they scored a touchdown. I just don't understand what was going on with Green Bay. I don't play the game, but it seems bonkers to me that the special teams co-ordinator didn't think a fake was coming. A field goal was meaningless in the context of the game and yet it still caught Green Bay completely by surprise.

HOW?

This is Pete Carrol we are talking about, he likes to take risks, he NEEDS a touchdown. I have heard commentators say play situational football, Green Bay were completely unprepared which means a large portion of the blame has to go on the coaches. Also some of the blame has to go on AJ Hawk for letting Gilliam run right past him leaving him wide open for an easy touchdown.

The next big moment was Wilson's fourth interception. Why did Burnett only run a few yards before dropping to the floor, because he was scared of fumbling the ball if he tried to return it further. I am convinced that if that had been Thomas or Chancellor they would have tried to pick up as many yards as possible. Green Bay had a three and out, McCarthy called three conservative run plays which lost yards. I understand he didn't want to stop the clock with an incompletion, but if he had got a first down they could have either eaten up more time or made Seattle use their time outs. Instead they ate up just over a minute off the clock and only managed a punt of thirty yards.

This is where I think the Green Bay players started to panic , they tried to up their game but it was too late. The momentum had swung against them and it is so hard to try and up your game once you have let up. I think here is the difference between the two teams.

Self belief.

I imagine Seattle were saying to themselves at half-time that here is an opportunity to show how great we are. 16-0 down at home, having played a terrible half and yet we're still very much in the game. This is something they thrive off, the chance to show others how great they are. Not to say Green Bay don't have self belief, but just not as much as Seattle, most teams would have folded after playing a half of football that badly. Instead Wilson drove them down the field and scored a touchdown.

The onside kick.

It is heartbreaking.

Again it is a case of play your role. Just like AJ Hawk before him Brandon Bostick went for the ball when he should have been blocking. If he had blocked Matthews, Jordy Nelson would have had a straight forward catch and most likely the game would have been over.

You can tell that I am more than a little prejudiced towards Seattle, but I have to take my hat off to them. They still had to go out and win the game, by sheer force of willpower and belief they managed to do it, they refused to lie down and be beaten. My brother in Seattle was ecstatic, I can't imagine what a roller coaster ride he went on during the game. I have to say it must have been amazing being a Seattle fan, definitely a game that will last long in the memory.

##### First place gets a shock

It was freezing on Saturday and I didn't have the car and had left my phone at work so I was going to cycle to the match. I wasn't looking forward to it and my fingers were very happy when Grundy stopped by to give me a lift. We were playing Glenfield Town who were top of the league. Their results weren't spectacular, they had won a lot of games but their biggest win was only 4-2.

They are a similar side to us in many respects, most of the players a bit older with a few young ones in the team to do the running.

The game ended up being spiky as the ref was very poor. It was as if a passerby strolled onto the pitch with a whistle and would blow it randomly. A late challenge by Kyle started it and soon everyone was exacting their own retribution because the referee was not doing anything about it. The tackles were not particularly dirty but a yellow card early on in the game would have kept it in check.

We sat back like last week's game and allowed them to come onto us. They only played with one up front, which meant our central defenders weren't pulled about too much. Also as we were deep there wasn't room in behind for them to exploit and when they tried to Heath was quick to mop it up. It did mean they had three in the middle but they weren't able to make the extra man count because he was playing a holding role and didn't venture forward often.

We had James and Kyle up front and they troubled their defence all game with their pace and aggression. Our goal came from a corner which they headed clear only for little Lee to volley back in past their static keeper. They had created nothing despite having most of the possession. We are definitely not a team for footballing purists.

I have not had many touches of the ball in the last few games, as we cede possession to the other team when I do get it I tend to be far back in my own half. I did have one hairy moment where I tried to head the ball back to Heath, I was on the six yard box and put too much on it. Fortunately it went wide and I only got a slight admonishing.

In the second half Kyle scored a beaut from 35 yards. The keeper was off his line and I think more by luck than judgement Kyle managed to lob him. After this goal they began to get frustrated. One of them nudged Kyle with his shoulder so Kyle did it back. Their player went for him and was in his face, Kyle just threw him to the ground. It was pretty funny. It took the referee an age to sort it out and booked their player when he refused to come over to him. Their player did get revenge when he booted Kyle on the leg later on in the game, the ref gave a foul but not a red.

Later on Grundy made a good tackle and cleared the ball, Lee shouted 'Tackle, Grundy' to which one of their players replied 'I get it he made a good tackle.' Lee repeated it and their player more annoyed and animated than before responded 'I get it he made a good tackle, you don't have to keep saying it.' It is no fun losing, especially when you think you should be winning. I couldn't stop smiling listening to their exchange, I nearly piped in with an exuberant 'Good tackle Grundy' but thought better of it as I didn't want to get walloped.

Dovey conceded a soft penalty, which shouldn't have been give and they converted it with 8 minutes left. I wasn't nervous after their goal, normally I feel a bit of anxiety and don't want to make a mistake, but I thought we were never going to lose this one. Their left back should have been sent off with a couple of minutes to go, he had already been booked a few minutes before for swearing at the ref. I had ball and took it past one of their players and ran to the corner flag to hold it up and waste time. Their left back came up behind me and wellied me, I ended up landing on my back as he had kicked me so hard. My calf hurt a bit where he hit me but I wasn't injured and soon got up. The ref had called him over and I was shocked when he only got a talking to. I said he should have been sent off and then endured a barrage of abuse from the left back. The ref said to me later that because I hadn't been injured he didn't need to book the player. The point of the tackle was to hurt me and he should have been sent off even though I wasn't hurt. From the resulting freekick I was caught offside, the most embarrassing offside. I was stood on the goal line the ball was about a metre further up the pitch, Kyle touched the ball to me and then I heard a cacophony of voices shouting 'Offside' I looked up, the linesman's flag was up and the defence was in line with the ball. I got another barrage of abuse from the left back which I ignored, although I should have responded with the old scoreboard chant. That was the last meaningful thing to happen in the game. A solid win against top of the table which puts us up to fifth.
