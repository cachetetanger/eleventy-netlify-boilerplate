All that was missing was a herd of cows, a rusting barbed wire fence and an overflowing trough in the corner of the meadow. The pitch was horrendous. It was like running through no-man's land without the shells and gunfire. Most of us played like we were shell shocked, knock kneed and bent double like old hags trudging through the mud, it was an abysmal game of football.

Last time we played them, they won a penalty when their striker dived over a challenge from Craig. This time the same player dived over a challenge from Craig to win another penalty. We were livid, absolutely livid. Craig even got booked for telling the referee he was crap. It was Craig's first ever yellow card. It is always frustrating to go behind when someone cons the referee, but it is so common now. It is not something that happens only in professional football, every level of football has it.

Part of the referee's thinking in deciding to give a penalty stemmed from a decision he gave a few minutes earlier. They had a cross into the box and their player went up for a header and Wes gave him a little nudge in the back. Outside of the area that would be a foul, but in the area it is a little too soft to give a penalty for. Anyway the ref blew his whistle and we all stopped thinking he was going to award a penalty, but he gave us a freekick instead. The ref was on the end of a few choice words from their players after that decision. After the game when asked if he was going to give a penalty, but realised it was in the area he diplomatically replied 'Pass'.

I am not blaming the ref for our performance, we were terrible and were lucky to only lose 5-1. We sat back, which is what we have been doing since Christmas, but we were also lethargic and slow to close down. At times it was like they were in a training game, they were pinging the ball about with no pressure on them. I lost my runner too many times to count and gave the ball away cheaply over and over. It felt as if we were a man down. Also Kyle was up front by himself which meant when he got the ball often our nearest player was 20 metres or further away from him. Give credit to Kyle, he never stopped working even though he had no help. We were 2-0 down at half-time but most peoples heads had gone, mine included. They scored quickly in the second half and then some players stopped trying. I know I made loads of mistakes and gave the ball away when I shouldn't have, but at least I didn't stop trying. At one point one of our players just walked back towards the goal as one of their players ran past him. It is always frustrating when that happens, needless to say it was a relief when the final whistle came.

Performances like this show how much we miss the likes of Banzi and James as they add so much to our attack. Hopefully they will be able to play next week, we are up against Broughton Astley Reserves.

Harry Kane did it again. Two goals against Arsenal. What an unbelieveable [header](http://www.goalopedia.com/goals/1986) to win the game, which moves us above them. Always good to see a local lad doing well, especially as he was spurned by Arsenal.

Also I have to say Seattle have been incredibly gracious in defeat. I thought they would be moaning about the loss but they have been magnanimous and congratulatory to the Patriots. I like this [picture](https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/tom-brady-richard-sherman-handshake.jpg?w=1023) of Sherman shaking Brady's hand after the game. My dislike for Pete Carroll and all things Seahawks has definitely changed, now I would say I am indifferent to how they do next year.
