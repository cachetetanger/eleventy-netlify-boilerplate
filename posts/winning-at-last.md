We have been firmly planted at the bottom of the table with only one point from our first five games. Last Saturday we lost 5-4 in the Cup to Cosby Reserves who are top of the Division Two. It was a good performance, we lost it in classic Park End fashion. From 4-2 down we got the score back to 4-4 before conceding straight from ensuing kick-off. We took some positives from the performance despite the result.

It started to rain as I left the house and when I got to our pitch it was raining a little harder. By the time we left the changing room to put up the nets and rope off the pitch it was bucketing it down. My hands froze within a few minutes of leaving the changing room, it is days like these that make people pack in football altogether, I can't quite convey how pathetically bedraggled we all looked. Part of the reason I keep playing is because of the camaraderie and banter we have. In the changing room before we headed out you wouldn't have know we had lost 4 games in a row. Kyle is a wind up merchant and has everyone in stitches. Unfortunately he has got a 4 game ban coming up for his [rant at the ref.](http://thecroggy.com/handball/)

By the time the opposition turned up I was shivering and couldn't wait for the match to start. We had the same ref as our last match, he is a good ref and keeps things calm on the pitch and banters a lot with the players. I won the toss and chose to have the wind at our back for the first half as I knew we would barely be able to get out of our half as the pitch would degenerate into a mud bath.

They were a young ill disciplined team who had great skills but not the stomach for a fight and when we took the lead the never looked like getting back into the game. They created a few chances but luck was on our side for once and Heath made a couple of decent saves that in previous games we wouldn't have been surprised if he'd let them in.

Half-time was miserable, I just wanted it over. Standing around in the driving rain, shivering. Half-time only lasted about five minutes before both sets of teams were ready to start again. We got a second goal when I flicked on a goal kick and Stu ran onto the ball and crossed it and one of their defenders ran it into the goal. It was around this point that my shorts began to fall down. They didn't have a drawstring and because they were so waterlogged they kept on falling down to reveal my boxers. This had the ref in hysterics.

We got a third soon after and by this point half their players had given up. We could have scored a few more, Kyle hit the bar and Lee had one cleared off the line.

Our first win of the season and against kids and I didn't care about the cold anymore.

We shared a beer in the changing room after the game and the banter was flying back and forth. Hopefully we can take some momentum from this game and get a win against Glenfield this Saturday.
