We’ve been in Morocco just over a week and are close to finally settling in. The ferry queue in Algeciras was chaotic, especially compared to Dover. There were a few Moroccans trying to direct cars and others taking it upon themselves to do what they wanted, the result was a line of cars going to the correct kiosk and the rest fanned out behind. The jostling for position started before the kiosk opened which meant the cars jammed in even closer together, no-one willing to lose an inch to someone else. We made it through near the back of the pack and got on the ferry which was meant to leave at 10 but left closer to 12. Fortunately we were one of the first cars off which meant we got to customs before they put the barrier down. It took about an hour to get through and the gendarme we were dealing with became cross when I asked him how long it would take. After ignoring me for about five minutes he came back and had a brief look in the car, handed me the completed paperwork and waved me on my way. At the insurance booth the attendant was sleeping and I woke him from his stupor with a loud ‘Salaam Alikoum.’ The insurance cost just under 2000 dirhams for three months which was less than I was expecting. Sorting out the insurance was the last unknown of the trip, with that completed I finally could relax and enjoy the drive to Tangier. The modern and old collide here, as we drove to Tangier a farmer was leading a cow across a pedestrian bridge over the motorway. The countryside is very green from the rains and the temperature is in the low 20s. I just about remembered my way to the Cachette, the Carrefour signs helped when I wasn’t too sure. They hadn't finished building it when I was here last year, but now there is a Carrefour and mall at the main roundabout at the bottom of the hill. We'd left England 9 days earlier and 2098 miles later we were parked outside the front gate of the Cachette. I unpacked the car whilst Caitlyn and the boys explored.

The house sits on a high hill overlooking Tangier, you can see the town beach and Malabata in the distnace. At night the whole city lights up below and the drone of car horns and sirens waft their way up the hill. The view always brings back special memories as I spent time here as a young boy and in my early twenties. Caitlyn and I stood arm and arm on the balcony looking out over Tangier, we breathed a sigh of relief and said to each other ‘We made it.’ Now it will be our home for the next three months and all the excitement and nervousness about what they hold hit me during that moment of quiet.  
Caitlyn busily got on with unpacking suitcases and organising their contents. After a couple of hours of work we started to cook dinner and Absalom popped in to say hello. He didn’t stay long and it was nice to see a friendly face.

My roof box must have murdered hundreds of insects on our way through Europe, as you can see the front of it is plastered with their mashed remains.

We slept in the main house and in the morning we headed to the Dradeb for breakfast in a cafe and bought food, sim cards and found a hardware shop where the men were helpful and very jolly. Loquats are in season, which we call wild boar in my family because they reminded my eldest brother of Asterix and Obelisk. Zohora came on Saturday to do the laundry, there was a large pile of it and we arranged for her to come the next week to do it again. Sunday we headed up to the park above the king’s palace and then onto the diplomatic forest(I seem to remember calling it that as a child). There were lots of Moroccans picnicking there and lots of rubbish, but it will be a nice place to go when it isn’t as busy. We found the French church on Sunday evening thanks to Clyde’s instructions and it was really great to meet other like minded people. We had felt rather isolated and disheartened before going as we hadn’t met many people, I don’t know what I was expecting, so it was nice to make some contacts. I am going on a run with one of them on Saturday morning and Cailtyn was able to get a lot of really useful information about schools from another lady. This week we have been working on getting the house how we want it, putting up shelves, making Aunty Tit’s room into our bedroom and sorting out mosquito nets for the windows. Everything takes a lot longer here, I bought a saw to cut wood from the hardware shop and some wood for shelves, when I got home I realised I hadn’t brought long enough screws with me to put up the shelf brackets. So another trip to the Dradeb ensued, but the shop was closed, also the boys need attending to so the work is really bitty. Most of the shelves are now up but I still need to finish the mosquito nets. The food has been good, although Asher wants cereal for breakfast everyday and we have limited it to Saturday much to his disappointment. Joey and Dani came one night this week, they arrived in the evening and their flight out was at 5.40 am, we stayed up all night chatting. It was great seeing them and they have given us a waffle maker which we can pick up from their house in Ait Kamra when we go with Caitlyn’s parents, so Asher should be appeased, although he’ll probably want waffles for breakfast everyday.  
The last two days have been really windy and tonight it has got even stronger, the trees are bowing quite a bit under it but as of yet no branches have fallen. Zohora did the washing today and amazingly hardly any of the clothes blew off the line. Yesterday we met with Amber Erzine, she took us out into her garden. I used to swim in the pool as a boy and the pool seemed so small in comparison to then. We hadn’t packed the boys swimming costumes and before we knew it Asher had climbed in using the ladder, he was fully clothed.

I handed my phone to Caitlyn in case he let go of the ladder. Luckily I did because about a minute later he pushed himself off the ladder and attempted to swim and I had to jump in, fully clothed. He was fine and didn’t understand the danger, he kept telling us he would walk along the bottom to the ladder and pull himself out. Later on, when we weren’t looking he jumped in again, this time I could reach him without jumping in and gave him a stern telling off. Amber kindly produced towels and we dried the boys, Caleb seeing his brother in the pool had kept on trying to elude us and jump in too. We caught him before he did, but not before he’d got his shorts and shirt soaked.
