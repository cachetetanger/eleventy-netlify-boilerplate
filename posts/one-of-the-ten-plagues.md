When we played Queeniborough last season it hailed so hard that we all begged the ref to end the game early, we were losing three nil and there were only a couple of minutes left. A huge black cloud was approaching and when it passed overhead the hailstorm it loosed was of biblical proportions. I have never been caught in a hailstorm like it and doubt I ever will again. I was expecting a swarm of locusts to appear on the horizon, I think some of my team mates have already been infected with boils. This time when we played them it didn't look like it was going to hail although there was a strong wind blowing from one end, fortunately we played against the wind first half. I prefer playing against the wind first, getting it out the way, otherwise it can be a miserable second half, tired and camped in our own half unable to kick the ball more than ten meters. At least if the wind is with you for the second half you can boot the ball away.

The first half was hard work as we knew it would be, I played in centre midfield with Grundy and we had Dan Gabriel as the right winger. When he sprints it looks like he is barely moving, a couple of times a ball was played for him to run onto and he just gave up because the covering defender got to the ball before he had even set off. Their left back had an easy time of it defensively as he knew Dan was never going to get past him.

Our left midfielder, another Tom who I had never played with before did a couple of terrible tackles. One of them wasn't considered a foul by the ref so I got hit by a late tackle straight after as their players were angered by the non-call. I thought the game was going to get out of control as there was a string of bad fouls which the ref didn't blow up. Fortunately the game cooled down a bit and didn't turn into the match we had against Birstall, when we got kicked off the pitch.

Dovey always wants us to play football and I normally agree with him, however at times it is better to play the percentages and get rid of the ball, this is especially true in defence. We had a throw-in by our corner flag and instead of throwing it down the line Dovey threw it to Craig on the edge of our box. Craig wasn't expecting it and tried to head it down field but the ball went to their striker who crossed it into the box to an unmarked player who scored. Dovey got the brunt of abuse as we wanted the ball to go down the line, he was pissed off because Craig panicked when the ball came into him. Quite a few of the goals we have conceded this season have been because Dovey has tried to play the ball out of defence. The problem with trying to play a bit is, how shall I put it? We are not very good. So more often than not our play breaks down, when that happens in our defensive third we generally give the opposition an opportunity to score.

Kyle who has been awesome this season has been going through a bit of a barren stretch in front of goal, he had a few good chances in the first half but never looked like scoring. His shoulder barges are still a sight to behold, the refs rarely blow up for a foul and the opposition players are left sprawling on the floor.

I wouldn't want to play against him.

We survived the first half only a goal down and probably had the better chances even if we had less possession. Chirs came off and Dubsy came on in his place. Dubsy is a character, he comes to watch all our games with a plastic bag containing a four pack of Carlsberg Export, he bloody loves the stuff. He had just hung up his boots but someone must have convinced him to come out and play for us again, he is a big unit and we put him up front with the express intention to hit long balls up to him for Kyle and Banzi to feed off. I feel completely unashamed by this arcane way of playing, Dovey on the otherhand was shaking his head in disgust. It worked a treat, with the help of the wind we could get the ball up to him easily, although Kyle and Banzi weren't always near him to make much of his flick ons.

We equalised from a freekick which I whipped into the back post, Dovey and Dubsy between them were able to bundle the ball in. The rest of the game became quite niggly as Tom kept on going in high on players, nicking their ankles and being a general menace. The referee didn't blow up any of his fouls and the game would have boiled over if it hadn't ended before anyone could exact revenge. There was one moment of contention just before the end of the game, they were attacking and their player was fouled but the ball fell to another of their players who smashed it into the top corner from twenty five yards. Unfortunately for him the ref had blown the whistle just before he had taken his shot for the foul. Both sets of players were laughing, except for the guy who had scored the goal, the resulting freekick went miles over.

Final score one all.

It was our final league game of the season and we ended up with more points than last season and a goal difference of only minus 3 which is a massive improvement on last seasons minus twenty five.

Harry Kane can do anything he wants. If he carries on at this rate he will be the next Spurs player to move onto Real Madrid. To score less than eighty seconds after making his England debut is mental, I am pleased for the lad, long may it continue.
