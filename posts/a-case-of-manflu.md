There have been incredible performances in sport when people have against all the odds been able to rely on their inner strength to pull them through. [The 1979 Cotton Bowl](http://125.nd.edu/moments/the-chicken-soup-game-1979-cotton-bowl-classic/) was played in freezing conditions and Joe Montana had the flu. Notre Dame went into half-time 20-12 down and Montana stayed in the changing room wrapped in blankets and the team doctors fed him chicken soup. He returned to the game in the fourth quarter with seven and a half minutes remaining with the score now 34-12 to Houston. Despite the flu he rallied them to the most unlikely comeback, throwing a touchdown to tie the scores as time ran out. Joe Unis kicked the extra point on the second time of asking for a famous win.

I woke up feeling not quite a hundred percent and in the changing room before the game I couldn't stop [shiver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwAd_ag9Q0E)ing. Craig left the footballs at his house so we didn't have any to warm up with, instead I tried to do a proper warm up but my left hamstring was tight and it hurt to sprint. This was a chance for me to dig deep and have a big game despite being ill, however instead of a Joe Montana performance it was more akin to Michael Carrick's for Tottenham in the [Lasagne Gate](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/10804881/2006-remembered-The-food-poisoning-bug-that-cost-Tottenham-Hotspur-their-Champions-League-dream.html) game. We ended up getting spanked seven nil, played off the park as opposed to being kicked off it like last time we played Birtsall.

There goes the dream of winning the cup.

When I got home I began to shiver and felt so sore, it was the same feeling after the first few games of the season. Not only was I feverish but my hamstrings and back were sore, it hurt to sit, to stand, to bend over. You name it, it hurt. My poor son could not work out why I just wanted to lie on the sofa and not throw the ball around with him.

Oh Tottenham. Why can't we play a Europa League team every game of the season. I bet Harry Kane wishes that was the case too.

Maybe the Cowboys are for real, in previous seasons they would have lost to the Jags, I can see them going all the way. Having said that how many times have they flattered to deceive, Romo will most likely choke again.

So Ben Roethlisberger throws back to back six touchdown games, the first person ever to do so. Aaron Rodgers decides six touchdowns in a game is too easy and does it in the first half instead.

Take that Big Ben!

An incredible performance but when you delve a little deeper you realise the NFL has made it far, far too easy for quarterbacks to succeed. It has become a joke. How is Manning better than he has ever been when he has no arm strength and has to use a zimmer frame to get around. The whole game has got really unbalanced, it favours passing far too much. The reason for that is player safety and herein lies the problem. The NFL is a brutal sport and now that there is an understanding of the long term health issues, the NFL has had to change it's rules to protect players. Which is right, but in doing so it has led to the sport being what it is today, quarterbacks putting up silly numbers.
